Crab is right; you are underestimating Nakashima. You say that based on Karasuno vs Wakunan Hinata was ""a pretty even match"", but Nakashima was *far* more impactful that game.

Nakashima single-handedly decimated Karasuno's defense. Karasuno's entire defensive game plan revolved around dealing with Nakashima, and they still had serious trouble with it. He was *constantly* tooling their blocks, while also hitting great line shots. By comparison, Hinata's impact was significantly lessened by having Wakunan's MBs commit block him, which meant that Karasuno scored most of their points through the left, where Asahi and Tanaka were effective despite having two blockers on them.

Nakashima is literally one of the top (pre-timeskip) outside hitters in the manga, not ""average"" as you described him in a previous comment.

hjakqg8,haikyuu,"I tend to dislike **characters that were retconned into the story** because it damages my immersion. This doesn't mean that those characters can't then go on to have a positive impact in the story, they absolutely can; it just means that they start off on a bad note.

**Asahi and Nishinoya:** A lot of people tend to forget that Asahi and Nishinoya were originally not in the story, but were only added later on. Their addition felt contrived to me because 1: they filled the exact 2 positions Karasuno had an issue with 2: they were the 2nd best and 3rd best players in the team, behind only Kageyama. Thankfully, despite this rough start, **they still turned out to be great additions to the story** later on.

**Lev:** Unlike Asahi and Nishinoya, who were fully redeemed, Lev wasn't. Lev could just not be in the story and honestly it would have been better; his role as a foil to Hinata is unnecessary because there are a gazillion other characters in the series that are also foils to Hinata, and his introduction into the story pushed Inuoka into obscurity, rendering all his screntime mostly worthless until he was reintroduced much, much later on, and in a vastly different role. All and all, **Lev is meh to me**.

**Kyotani:** The shitty crown of worst character to be retconned in goes to Kyotani for sure. I feel like his introduction was an extreme attempt to spice Seijoh up, but Seijoh needed no such thing. Seijoh wasn't going to be boring or uninteresting because they'd be the same. In fact, Seijoh's consistency and stability could clash with Karasuno's rapid changes in a more direct and interesting way. Instead, a huge chunk of the Karasuno vs Seijoh spring regionals match is focused around this one new character.

> How many years have you been playing the game in order to understand it in such a complete way?

Even at the lowest levels of the semi-pro scene, pretty much everyone has been playing the game for a minimum of 3-4 years, usually more. Players who can get to that level generally have been either playing the game since they were quite young or have had relevant gaming experience before. The best player I've ever worked with, only started playing LoL when he was already 19 and ended up becoming a Worlds semifinalist, but he was an extremely skilled Counter Strike player prior to that.

> Did you ever start up at an amateur team (local team built between friends)

Pretty much every single player has been in some sort of team before going semi-pro; cases where someone goes straight from solo queue into a semi-pro team with 0 prior team experience are extremely rare. For what it's worth, the first team I ever managed was an amateur team with 2 players being my close friends another one from my high school.

> Do you consider D2+ players could go pro? Why/Why not?

Even for the lower levels of the semi-pro scene, D2 is a pretty low rank. From my experience, even players in lower-end semi-pro teams are usually at least D1, and those are generally the players that have more achievents to show than just their solo queue rank.

> Have you ever had to put INSANE amounts of effort into your practice, content creation, etc.?

This varies highly from person to person. The people that generally put the most effort into their improvement are those that either are highly ambitious and want to succeed no matter what, or those that see a potential opportunity that they want to jump on but need improvements in order to.  

> What advice would you give to a player who wants to go pro? (This can refer to both advice inside and outside of the game)

* Join a team that participates in some sort of organized competition as soon as possible; experience in a team environment is extremely important

* Learn how to play champions that are competitive staples in your position

* Don't just play; put some time into reviewing and evaluating your own gameplay. Even better if you can get someone else's opinion too

* Decide what you want from LoL in your life and keep a proper balance between LoL and the rest of your life based on that

gw5uzzm,haikyuu,"> He was already a really good player in highschool

First off, no he wasn't. He was a player who was really good in a few specific aspects and ranged from decent to bad in everything else. In terms of overall individual ability, he was shown to be the worst starting player in his own team. But, even if he was a really good player ih high school, that would barely even matter at all. Being a top player in your age group means next to nothing in a senior setting with no age limitations; that's why the overwhelming majority of players in age-restricted competitions can't replicate their achievements in senior competitions.

First off, he didn't play beach volleyball professionally, but semi-professionally. A professional player would not also have two other jobs on the side. Second, people don't get better in indoor volleyball by playing beach volleyball, they do it by playing indoor volleyball.

**It comes out of nowhere with no basis or foreshadowing.**  >!Literally what happens is that like 15 mins before the grand reveal there's a flashback where the protagonist goes like ""btw I had a brother and he died many years ago"" and then the grand reveal is the brother actually being the villain all along.

Then, all of these get thrown in the garbage for the sake of an asspull intended for shock value. It's as if the writer(s) thought that good plot twist = surprising the audience at any and all costs, including tossing everything up to this point out the window. Perhaps the most egregious part; turns out the protagonist just happened to get migraine every single time the villain was doing stuff. Could this *be* any more contrived?!<

**It breaks every other route by establishing non-sequitur causality.** >!The plot twist establishes that the villain is the protagonist's brother, not the protagonist himself. So if that's the case, then where the absolute hell is the villain in every other route?? The developments of the other routes only make sense if the protagonist is the villain, meaning they are no longer actual story developments that the player/reader can lead the story towards with their choices, but unattached alternate universe scenarios that have nothing to do with the true route. Because as things stand after the reveal, the only other explanation is that the villain saw his brother getting laid with some girl and somehow decided to drop his massive terroristic plans that seemingly involve millions of dollars and thousands of people.!<

**It chickens out of answering a difficult question that was a point of high interest.** >!The protagonist and the main girl have feelings for each other, but matters are complicated because of their history wtih their parents. When the protagonist acts as his villain persona, he's out to kill her for revenge... woops, never mind, since the protagonist isn't actually the villain.

Not *any* anime, but yes, I understand your frustration. It is a practice common not just in anime but in other mediums as well.

Let's do a direct comparison of Tsukishima and Kindaichi, both middle blockers and of the same age.

Tsukishima spent his middle school years not really caring about volleyball. Kindaichi was at a prestigious middle school with a serious volleyball program. That means that Kindaichi had fullfilled a much larger part of his potential as a player by the time he got into high school. Yet despite that, Tsukishima was just as good if not even slightly better than him even back then. That means that Tsukishima has bigger potential than Kindaichi, since he was at a similar level despite having fullfilled a smaller part of his. Already, Tsukishima has the advantage.

During their first year of high school, Kindaichi kept practicing as usual and became better at his rate. Meanwhile, Tsukishima began caring about volleyball and actively trying to improve in it. Because the more of your potential you have untapped the easier it is improve, Tsukishima began improving rapidly. Not only that, but he was personally mentored by an excellent blocker because said excellent blocker had personal reasons as for why he wanted Tsukishima to get better. It's safe to assume Kindaichi had no such  massive outside assistance. These factors combined resulted in explosive improvement for Tsukishima, and by the time of the Miyagi spring high regional qualifier, he was a lot better than Kindaichi.

What could Kindaichi have realistically done to be as good as Tsukishima? The answer is, nothing. People are constrained by their circumstances, and short of a deus ex machina, he didn't have a chance of remaining near Tsukishima's ability when the latter began actually caring about volleyball.

There are some common points between Haikyuu and KnB. Both are action-driven sports shows with a lot of hype. They also both have copious amounts of attractive teenage boys (attracting BL fans who ship them) and comedy. But while KnB is an incoherent, nonsensical mess without the slightest hint of self-awareness and destroys the sport it's supposed to portray, Haikyuu is grounded, realistic, and has characters that actually feel like humans rather than stereotypical caricatures. 

I feel as if Haikyuu has all the good points of KnB (comedy/hype/animation), while also adding many more (coherence, logic, plot, characters, soundtrack). But then again, I didn't like KnB, so maybe someone that enjoyed both series can give you a better comparison than me.",9,False

Overall, I enjoyed Grisaia, but it was also a disappointment. Going into it, I expected something much, much better than what I actually got.

Fruit was decent. It started out very well with the common route, but then I found the character routes to be of varied enjoyment. Akane and Makina had the good ones, Yumiko was unremarkable but fine I guess, and Sachi and Michiru (particularly the latter) sucked.

Characters were mostly meh. Yuuji was so incredibly good at everything that he just ended up completely uncompelling, damaging the narrative tension. Akane was interesting but had way too much of a focus on her sexual identity rather than actually delving deeper into more intriguing mental aspects. Yumiko is such a stereotypical kuudere it just feels by the numbers. Yet that's still far better than Michiru, the walking joke, Makina, the annoying brat ruining most scenes she's in, and Sachi, who belongs in a parody rather than ""serious"" fiction.

Interestingly enough, even though I mostly disliked the main cast as units, I think they had great chemistry. They really play off well with each other, especially when it comes to comedy. I found that to be one of the absolute best things about the franchise.

Labyrinth was the worst. The story was boring and the sexual aspects got disturbing as the protagonist went abotu screwing pretty much every breathing female being in his life, regardless of the implications. The After segments were not bad, but the main plot was just zzzzzzzzzzz. Eden returned to Fruit's level of decent, providing an interesting finish. Just don't think too hard about it, cause everything will fall apart. Also, the real identity of Thanatos was foreshadowed so stupidly much you'd have to be dumber than Michiru not to have figured it out a minimum of several hours before the reveal.

The production was very good. Art was excellent, voice acting ranged from good to great (Michiru sucked as a character but her voice actress was incredible), soundtrack was fine. The were plenty of features to make the novels more convenient and/or engaging.

**Rambing over**. These were just some thoughts I vomitted out of the spot.

Let's compare him to Asahi point by point, separating everything by how important they are to their positions as wing spikers. Order is technical attributes first, then mental, then physical.

**Primary importance:**

**Serving:** About the same. Nakashima can aim them better, Asahi can put more power on them.

**Spiking:** Nakashima wins easily, he was consistently wiping out blocks vs Karasuno and could also hit accurate line shots when preferred. Asahi has good spiking technique compared to almost everyone, but Nakashima is just too good on this aspect.

**Composure:** Nakashima is better. Asahi has managed to overcome his formerly crippling issues to a major extent, but when compared with Nakashima, he's not quite there yet.

**Jumping Reach:** Asahi can reach higher because he's a lot taller, even though Nakashima actually has a bigger jump.

**Stamina:** Nakashima, the man who showed no real sign of fatigue after playing 3 full sets despite jumping all the time, clearly has more stamina.

**Strength:** Asahi has more strength, Nakashima is strong too but Asahi is just top tier when it comes to physical strength.

**Secondary importance:**

**Blocking:** Both have unremarkable blocking technique.

**Underhand:** About the same, Nakashima has picked up balls that'd be too much for Asahi but also failed on easier ones.

**Movement:** Nakashima moves a bit smarter around the court when his team is in possession. Asahi's approach is too one-dimensional.

**Positioning:** Both seem to have a decent grasp, nothing noteworthy.

**Tertiary importance:**

**Overhand:** We've barely seen either of them actually use their overhand.

**Anticipation:** Nakashima doesn't seem remarkable on this department, but considering that Asahi is pretty much a purely reactive player, Nakashima takes it.

**Decisions:** Easy win for Nakashima, who has been shown to actually think on the court on a consistent basis, adapting to the circumstances.

**Agility:** Again easy win for Nakashima, Asahi seems clumsy by comparison.

**Speed:** Nakashima is much faster.

Verdict: Nakashima is the better player. Asahi is not far behind and he has his own strong points over Nakashima, but Nakashima simply contributes more to his team on the court.",3,False

 - [~~Trigun~~](https://img.animebracket.com/36ri.jpg) - [**Evangelion Rebuilds**](https://img.animebracket.com/374o.jpg)

 - [**Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai!**](https://img.animebracket.com/36tp.jpg) - [~~Date A Live~~](https://img.animebracket.com/36wj.jpg)

Ultimately a pleasant watch despite its many problems. I should actually finish the second season sometime, I think I put it on hold like 4 episodes in.

 - [~~Gintama~~](https://img.animebracket.com/36qa.jpg) - [**Golden Time**](https://img.animebracket.com/3760.jpg)

Hardest decision of the day. Gintama has many moments of absolute brilliance hidden in its immense quantity of content, but is often underwhelming. Golden Time had some major issues affecting it as a whole but also carries strong elements. Overall I'm giving it to Golden Time; perhaps because of my recent rewatch. Shoutout to the Sato Takaya a.k.a. 2D-kun, one of the absolute best supporting characters to ever grace any anime.



 - [~~Durarara!!~~](https://img.animebracket.com/36pm.jpg) - [**Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata**](https://img.animebracket.com/376u.jpg)

Durarara started out very interesting before gradually becoming more and more about style rather than substance. I'd still prefer it over Saekano if it were not for the character of Megumi Kato, by far the best female character I've ever seen in an anime, who single-handedly carries the show.


 - [**Haikyuu!!**](https://img.animebracket.com/36tx.jpg) - [~~91 Days~~](https://img.animebracket.com/37a1.jpg)

Haikyuu is the second best anime I have ever watched. It's extremely powerful on all fronts: plot, characters, and production are all top-notch. I cannot recommend it enough; a very small percentage of people would not be able to draw at minimum some serious enjoyment out of it.

 - [~~Dragon Ball~~](https://img.animebracket.com/370v.jpg) - [**Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry**](https://img.animebracket.com/36x6.jpg)

I originally dropped Rakudai after the very first episode because it looked like it was just gonna be yet another harem with a superpowered protagonist. After revisiting it at the urging of some stranger online, it turned out that although I was partially right, it actually had a lot of things going for it. Big props to the romance plot in particular, probably the highlight. Boring action, though.

 - [~~Bakemono no Ko~~](https://img.animebracket.com/36wc.jpg) - [**Toradora!**](https://img.animebracket.com/36z7.jpg)

 - [**Great Teacher Onizuka**](https://img.animebracket.com/370c.jpg) - [~~Fullmetal Alchemist (2003)~~](https://img.animebracket.com/3743.jpg)

Despite some major weaknesses, I ultimately found Great Teacher Onizuka to be a pleasant comedy with good ability of turning serious when needed.

 - [**Sakamoto desu ga?**](https://img.animebracket.com/36uj.jpg) - [~~Shinsekai yori~~](https://img.animebracket.com/36v2.jpg)

Literally the very first anime I watched when I decided to get into anime, it had just finished airing and everyone was talking about how great the opening was. 10/10 opening, 6/10 show. It was occasionally hilarious but often boring. But because it's the good moments that stick, it's ultimately a pleasant memory.

What about his incredible composure, extremely high vertical reach. immense stamina, and excellent spiking technique?

Understatement of the year

> But there was very little in the area of tooling blocks and hitting the best spots

Why would he attempt to tool blocks when he could either spike the ball over them or hit somewhere the blocks did not cover? Karasuno did not attempt to completely shut him down until the final point. As for hitting the best points, on more than one occasion he was shown to have excellent technique, such as the aforementioned final point.

> As soon as Noya got a hold of the spin of the ball from a left hander and Tsuki's strategy was set there was very little to stopping the guy

Yeah, all it took to stop him (half the time) was three blockers to narrow his spiking path and the best libero in the prefecture to receive the ball. ""Very little"" indeed.


> Can't see how he would have being that dangerous against taller and stronger team. Both Karasuno's MBs are pretty small, Hinata in height and Tsuki (at least it looks like it) in weight.

You make it sound as if Karasuno is some team awful at defense. 

> Can't see how he would have being that dangerous against taller and stronger team. 

As explained earlier, height and power are not the only things Ushijima has going for him.

> Both Karasuno's MBs are pretty small, Hinata in height and Tsuki (at least it looks like it) in weight.

This is a very flimsy argument. Tsukishima being relatively light does not somehow unmake him one of the prefecture's best blockers. Hinata isn't nearly as good but he's not dead weight in the air, either.

> Also pretty much everyone else besides Asahi looks below average in height.

Yeah, Karasuno isn't a particularly tall team, but let's not forget they also possess a highly capable floor defense.

> Can't see how teams like Dateko and Kamomedai would have not slammed Shiratorizawa and Ushijima.

Dateko lost easily to both Karasuno and Seijoh; how are they supposed to ""slam"" Shiratorizawa? Not to mention the fact that Shiratorizawa actually beat Dateko last year. As for Kamomedai, we can reasonably assume they are about as strong as Shiratorizawa, since both teams finished Top 8 in the interhigh. It'd be a close match, not a ""slam"".

His technical ability is decent overall. His spiking and underhand are rather good. His serves are not really technical, but rather power-oriented, resulting in many mistakes. His overhand is unremarkable at best and his blocking is poor.

Mental ability is where Kyotani gets really dragged down, so many weaknesses to be pointed out. He's awful at teamwork. He has shaky composure. His decision making is practically non-existent, as is his ability of anticipation. Finally, he is extremely inconsistent and temperamental.

Overall, he's about as good as Kunimi, worse than Hanamaki, and far worse than Iwaizumi.

eh8wanv,haikyuu,"> Karasuno will be dusted. Sawamura is one of their most important players and Iwaizumi can't produce the defensive output he can

Iwaizumi being slightly less capable on defense is not even close to making up for the fact that he will contribute much more than Sawamura in other aspects of the game. Flat out, Iwaizumi has more overall individual ability than Sawamura. 

Sawamura is an excellent receiver, but Iwaizumi is not far behind on that aspect. Sawamura is better when it comes to the technical aspect of receiving, but Iwaizumi's superior athleticism makes a lot of the difference by allowing him to get to very difficult balls. Just watch the springhigh Karasuno vs Seijoh match for some incredible defensive feats by Iwaizumi.

So, we've established that Sawamura is slightly better at receiving. I'm also going to give him a small edge on the mental aspect for being more consistently composed. As for pretty much everything else, Iwaizumi is better. On the physical aspect, the difference is massive. Iwaizumi is faster, stronger, more agile, and can reach higher. At the technical aspects of offense, Iwaizumi is a better spiker and server.

Iwaizumi is a bigger asset for a team than Sawamura.

eh8rk4q,haikyuu,"Since the time of switch has not been specified, I'm going to assume **it happens at the beginning of the series** and every other character accepts it as a normal thing instead of something absurd and out of place. Under normal Japanese high school rules it would that they would be unable to participate in high school team competitions, but let's suspend our disbelief for the sake of this alternate scenario.

Ability wise, it's obvious that the switch benefits Karasuno. Iwaizumi is better than Daichi and Oikawa is far, far better than Sugawara.

If Karasuno can get at least one of Oikawa and Kageyama to swallow their pride and work for the team instead of antagonizing each other, they are going to be far stronger than their canon iteration. Karasuno will utilize a 6-2 formation, with both Oikawa and Kageyama acting as setters and spikers simultaneously; a far better arrangement that having one of them on the bench.

Remember when an Oikawa-less Seijoh lost to a Karasuno team that was missing two of its three best players? Well, this iteration of Seijoh is even weaker. They have no chance of standing up to Shiratorizawa or this Karasuno.

Karasuno will smash Seijoh at the interhigh qualifiers and may even go on to beat Shiratorizawa.

eesp2sj,haikyuu,"Before deciding which of the current first years would make a better captain, we need to determine exactly what a captain's responsibilities are and what characteristics he must posses.

The captain must lead and motivate the other players, be a role model for them, and also provide a communicational link between the players and the coaching staff when needed. Other stuff the captain should be doing are resolving problems between players and helping new players settle into the club.

The captain should be a regular, but besides that, he should also be a good player. There will be more respect for a captain who's also a good player. A regular on the verge of losing his regular spot isn't really suitable for a captain. It's easier for the captain to motivate players when he pulls his weight on the court. That means that besides being a good player overall, the captain must also actually give a good example by being determined, brave, hard working, and working well with the other players. If he does the above, the rest of the players will follow, and the team will function better.

The captain should have a good personality. But besides being good overall, that personality should also be at least a decent match for that of the general personality of the team. Although the captain can motivate the rest of the players to follow his lead, if the difference is too big, there's going to be problems. For example, an ambitious captain isn't fit to lead a team of unambitious players, as there will be conflict.

Finally, age. Especially considering the fact that Haikyuu is set in Japan, being older means the captain will be more respected. Also, he's going to have more experience. But since we are talking about people of the same age, this doesn't matter in this case.

Based on the above, it's practically impossible to make a good choice on captain for two years later. Personalities and ability change, and in this age, they change a lot. We can only assume in what ways they will have changed two years from now, it's impossible to know for sure.",12,False

The main conflict of the Mandalorian Wars began 12 years before KotOR II and ended 3 years after that. In that time period, the Disciple ""came of age"" to become a Jedi Padawan. We know this because he was hoping that the Exile would take him as her Padawan, but she was off fighting in the war. That means that the age in which a Jedi youngling ""comes of age"" to become a Jedi Padawan is somewhere between 13 and 16.

When the Exile was a Padawan, she had an informal student - master relationship with Kavar even though another Jedi was her official Master. Kavar mentions that this relationship was already in place when the Mandalorian Wars first broke out, which was 25 years before the events of KotOR II. Combine that with the information that the minimum age for a Padawan is 13, and that means the Exile was at least 38 years old in KotOR II.

KotOR I takes place 5 years before KotOR II, and the The Old Republic: Revan novel establishes that Bastila is 10 years younger than the Exile. Therefore, Bastila is at least 23 years old in KotOR I.

So what? Of course their best player was vital to their achievements. This goes for all teams. If you remove Ushijima from Shiratorizawa, the team he carries just as much Oikawa carries Seijoh, they would have certainly lost to Seijoh in the interhigh prefectural final and I doubt they'd even be able to beat Kesenike West in the spring high prefectural semifinals either. Karasuno without Kageyama wouldn't have been able to beat Dateko or Wakunan. Dateko without Aone and Wakunan without Nakashima would be unremarkable teams. etc

> they don't have other players near Oikawa's skill. All the other powerhouse schools have multiple players that are strong, Seijoh just has Oikawa.

That's just not true. If you set the bar for ""strong"" so high, then Shiratorizawa also only has just one strong player, Ushijima. Seijoh's and Shiratorizawa's second best players, Iwaizumi and Tendou, are about the same in overall individual ability for their positions. By your extremely high standards that leave out Iwaizumi, the only ""strong"" players in the prefecture would be Ushijima, Oikawa, Kageyama, Nishinoya, Nakashima, and Aone.

> they suck. They have a whole gym of mediocre players

""mediocre"" is subjective; they sure are mediocre if we are comparing them to Oikawa, but Oikawa is the second best player in the prefecture. If they had a full team of players with Oikawa's ability, they'd be destroying Shiratorizawa comfortably.

> Fukurodani's got a first year too whose like Kindaichi in stats and height, but because the rest of the team is talented I'm not thinking ""they picked that first year cause they need to"" I'm thinking ""they picked that first year cause they thought he'd add something special to their team""

You are missing the point; it's **both** of these. They did pick him because they need to, he's the best choice they have available. And he does add something ""special"" to their team, the fact that he's the best player out of those they could use.

>Seijoh is supposed to be a powerhouse school

They **ARE** a powerhouse school. Unless you believe a school that made prefectural finals in Interhigh and prefectural semifinals in spring high is not one, I guess.

You say that as if it's a massively bad thing; obviously Yahaba isn't anywhere close to Oikawa in ability and Oikawa's loss would utterly cripple Seijoh, but Yahaba is still a perfectly serviceable setter. In fact, he's quite better overall than Sugawara, Karasuno's second setter.

**Person A:** 160 cm tall, 200 cm standing vertical reach, can jump 100 cm with a run-up and therefore has 300 cm jumping vertical reach

**Person B:** 200 cm tall, 250 cm standing vertical reach, can jump 50 cm with a run-up and therefore has 300 cm jumping vertical reach

Here we have a very short person with a very good jump and a tall person (not *very* tall for professional standards, 2 meters is close to the average for a pro) with a very poor jump. Their jumping vertical reach is the same, but assuming that they are otherwise identical in their ability, the tall person with the very poor jump still has a big advantage.

Due to having less distance to cover, Person B reaches the apex of their jump faster than Person A, which means they have more time to react. Their margin of timing error is higher than that of Person A.

Person B is more flexible. If Person A wants to fight at the net, they have to commit; while Person B can still get their hands over with a light jump, leaving open other possibilities for the rally.

Taller people naturally have more physical strength. A 200 cm person of an average build will be much stronger than a 160 cm person of an average build.

As the game goes on and the players get tired, their jumps will not be as strong. For Person B, only being able to get 70% of their usual jump still means they can reach 285 cm. For Person A, the same percentage would leave them at 270 cm.

It's no coincidence that professional players are all very tall; height is a massive advantage on its own. The current average height of the Brazil national team, ranked #1 in the world, is 198.2 cm, and that includes the liberos. Without them, it's 200.3 cm.",4,False

Team Aces has a simple strategy: to get a decent ball up for one of their best hitters and to decimate the block. Nothing fancy required; their plan is to overwhelm the enemy defense with the high individual ability of their spikers. They will make use of their strong points; spiking technique, vertical reach, and physical strength.

Team Setters is outclassed on an individual level. Their setting is obviously far superior, enabling for a variety of ways to attack, but this doesn't matter a lot when their two best spikers are about as capable as the opposing team's worst spiker. Their receiving is far worse too, and their only real hope of dealing with the opposing attacks is hoping that their blocks (the capability of which depends highly on the specific rotation) will hold up.

Yamamoto a significantly more effective spiker due to his advantage in spiking technique and physical strength, but other than that, Daichi is a better player in pretty much every way. Better overall technique, better decision making, better agility and speed. A very similar comparison can be made for Tanaka, who is very close to Yamamoto in both overall ability and skillset, but oriented more towards offense.

Fukunaga is an incredibly well-rounded player that consistently displays high-caliber technical ability and decision making as well as excellent composure. He seems to be the best in overall individual ability out of these four choices, his on-court contributions are bigger.

> As an ace he brings nothing that exceeds expectations to the table. He is not formidable or elite rather in any one aspect of the game.

Yeah, but why is that an issue? Being well-rounded isn't an inherently bad thing. You make it sound as having a bigger discrepancy in ability between the various aspects of the game means you are a better player, which is obviously not the case.

> Considering how well rounded seijoh is all they need to break their shell is more fire power. Even after adding mad dog back which increases attack power. And gives them a nice hinata-like decoy effect iwaizumi still could not break through on the left.

Yes, Seijoh could use some more fire power. Iwaizumi's offensive capabilities are definitely behind those of aces that play in teams of similar level. But focusing on just that completely disregards his contributions on other aspects of the game. Even disregarding all that, why would this somehow put the blame for Seijoh's constant defeats against Shiratorizawa on Iwaizumi? Everyone on their starting lineup except Oikawa gets outclassed onne way or another; it's not just Iwaizumi.

> In my opinion if oikawa had any of the current versions of the spikers I mention above from 1-9 in s2 they beat karasuno and shiratorizowa.

Some of these spikers are obvious upgrades over Iwaizumi (Ushijima, Bokuto, Hoshiumi, Aran), others are debatable (Asahi, Takeru, Fukunaga), others are weaker (Suguru, Terushima).

> Simply because each one of them bring something to the table that iwaizumi does not.

Yes, each player is different and comes with their own strengths and advantages over Iwaizumi. This does not automatically mean they are more capable overall.

**Conclusion:** Iwaizumi's offensive ability is definitely inferior to that of many other aces in the series, but to say he's ""Iwaizumi is the **sole reason** why seijoh loses to shiratorizowa every year"" when he's Seijoh's second-best player is flat-out wrong.",8,False
e89ahjm,haikyuu,"> Asahi is very important and underrated

He's massively important and absolutely integral to Karasuno's success, but I wouldn't call him underrated. His contributions are getting noticed appropriately.

> His attacking ability as well as defensive reliability is essential for this team

Attacking ability definitely, defensive reliability not quite. His top-notch strength combined with very good spiking technique and high vertical reach make him a great spiker, but defensively he's not better than just fine. His blocks are high but not particularly skilled, and his underhand technique as well as defensive positioning are just decent. His strength is helpful when it comes to receiving powerful hits.

Overall, his defensive contributions are not even close to his offensive ones.  He's the single most important attacker on Karasuno, but defensively he's outclassed by many of his teammates; Nishinoya, Daichi, Tsukishima, even Kageyama.

> Furthermore his spikes and jump serves are not only increasing in consistency but are also extremely powerful

Yes, but Asahi is not the only one increasing in ability. Literally every player in Karasuno improves as the series progresses.

> Compared to other Aces we have seen thus far it would not be far-fetched to say he is a top 10 Ace in the series so far

Yeah, agreed. The aces I can think of who are better than Asahi and have made an appearance or have been mentioned so far are: Sakusa, Kiryu, Ushijima, Aran, Bokuto, Nakashima, and Iwaizumi. I'd put him in the top 10. 

> That said his defense is crucial and his receiving is very high level

I disagree. As mentioned above, both his technical ability and positioning are decent but not particularly good. His strength is an asset, but not enough to make up. His ability in receiving is significantly behind that of Nishinoya and Daichi, and from the few instances we've seen his receive it's reasonable to assume that Kageyama is better at it too.

>his leaving next year will leave a large hole in karasuno that neither tanaka or narita or hinata are ready to fill.

Asahi's departure is definitely the one Karasuno will struggle the most to cope with; they already suffer from a wing spiker shortage and Asahi is their best. Tanaka's skillset is similar but his overall ability is not up to par with Asahi's, and Narita and Hinata are just completely different players, their skillset is so unrelated there's no need to even mention them.

> His height is very close to 190cm >5cm away from being that height

His height is definitely one of his biggest assets, but no reason to get obsessed with 190 cm in particular. That's just an arbitrary benchmark.

> his game sense is good as well.

Definitely not, can you explain how you arrived to this conclusion? His movement and positioning are both decent, so only a small step down from good, but his anticipation as well as general decision making are completely unremarkable if not flat-out bad.

> He is definitely better than iwaizumi.

I disagree. I'd say he's better only if we compare manga Asahi to anime Iwaizumi, which is of course an unfair comparison, since Asahi gets 3 months of development Iwaizumi does not. Comparing them by their anime showing, I'd say they are at about the same level of ability. Asahi is definitely better on the offensive side, while Iwaizumi is far more capable when it comes to defense and also contributes to his team in ways of mentality.

> IMO I would take him over Aran for his receiving and block crushing attack.

I disagree but I see where you are coming from. I agree with Asahi is better when it comes to defeating blocks, but he seems to fall behind Aran on most other aspects of the game, so I'd definitely pick Aran.

> Because of his height and overall size I'm surprised he is not talked about as much to be honest.

His size is not remarkable at all when compared to the top aces, they are bigger than him.

> If was more confident in himself I think he could be a top 5 ace like bokuto

He has already gone a long way towards getting over his confidence issues and he's still not as good enough as Bokuto. Don't underestimate Bokuto, he has his own crippling quirk but is still better despite that.

e7jm4g4,haikyuu,"> If the Little Giant was such an up and coming star, why was he only famous during his second year Spring tournament and never after?

Was he even an up and coming star? He was short; his potential was inherently limited by that. But regardless of that, the reason he was only famous during the spring tournament of his second year was because that was the only time he played in a national tournament and therefore got to be seen by a lot of people.

> They only went to the Spring Tournament once. If he was still around and so good, shouldn't they have gone there again?

Not at all. Karasuno managed to upset the dominating champions Shiratorizawa once; that doesn't mean they would necessarily do it again. Shiratorizawa has a massive advantage over Karasuno in things like infrastructure and player recruitment, just because they lost one final doesn't mean their dominance would end.

> And afterwards, sure, Karasuno had a downfall, but why was it to that much of an extent? All teams do get awesome players from time to time, but solid teams never fall so apart or so completely off the radar like Karasuno did.

Because coach Ukai retired. This caused a massive dent to Karasuno's player-recruiting capabilities, as there was no longer Ukai's reputation to attract players. Not only that, but without a coach, the quality of practice dropped significantly, so even that players who did go to Karasuno did not improve as much as they could have otherwise.

> I mean, surely, there should have also been some sort of follow up on the Little Giant if he was still playing volleyball.

Why? Even if he is still playing volleyball (which may not even be the case), that doesn't mean he'd be interested in doing something that would put him in the story, like showing up at games of his high school team.

> It's like he was legend who inspired a generation only to have such an obscure existence. 

That's a massive overstatement. He did draw a lot attention in his one participation in nationals, but as far as we know the only people who he directly inspired are a few players in Miyagi.

Bus routes are active from about 5 am to midnight every day. There's also one single bus route that is active during the night hours, it goes from the center of the city to the airport in the east. You mentioned you are going to live near Orfanidou street; that night bus route does stop close to there.

**SCENARIO 1:** Futakuchi and Tanaka replace each other. Futakuchi is slightly more capable overall, so that's a small individual upgrade for Karasuno. Aone replaces Hinata, which overall is a decent upgrade for Karasuno. His position is taken by an unknown middle blocker who is assumed to be of ability slightly less than that of Fukiage, dealing a big blow to Dateko. Nishinoya replaces Sakunami, which is an enormous boost for Dateko. His position is taken by Sugawara, resulting in an overall big downgrade of for Karasuno. Ultimately, I'd say that Karasuno gets a small downgrade and Dateko a small upgrade.

Karasuno is still undoubtedly the better team, though not by as much as before. **Karasuno wins 8/10 games**.

e445r74,haikyuu,"In Seijoh, Ushijima replaces Kunimi and Yahaba takes over Oikawa's spot. The change in overall individual ability is negligible, but they lose their captain and on-court tactician, crippling their chemistry.

In Shiratorizawa, Oikawa replaces Shirabu and an unknown wing spiker (of ability assumed to be slightly less than that of Goshiki) takes over Ushijima's spot. Just like with Seijoh, the change in overall individual ability is negligible. However, Shiratorizawa can efficiently adjust to a different playstyle not revolving around Ushijima, mainly because of Oikawa leading them.

**SCENARIO 1:** This version of Shiratorizawa can perform about as well as the original, while by comparison Seijoh is weakened. Since Shiratorizawa was already stronger than Seijoh, the gap simply grows. **Shiratorizawa wins 8/10 times**.

**SCENARIO 2:** Oikawa is a slightly better server than Ushijima, but for this scenario we also need to take into account who's receiving. Shiratorizawa's receivers are Yamagata, Ohira, and Goshiki. Seijoh's receivers are Watari, Iwaizumi, and Hanamaki. Shiratorizawa's receiving team is more capable overall. Since Oikawa is already a more capable server, there's nothing more to add here. **Oikawa wins**.

**SCENARIO 3:** Oikawa is clearly far better at both managing and leading a team. As for dynamics with coaches, the ideologies of both players are going to different with their new coaches. However, coach Irihata has a rather hands-off approach, so he's less likely to clash with Ushijima. By comparison, there will almost certainly be a clash between Oikawa and coach Washio. Overall, **it's a draw**.

**BONUS QUESTION:** 

> Do you think they can make it to the team? 

**There's a small chance for Ushijima**. So far he's on the right path, but only a tiny percentage of youth national players ever make it to the men's team, and for now he's just a starter for the U18 team, not even close to making it into the men's team. **As for Oikawa, there's just no chance**. Not only is he seemingly already approaching his full potential, but he just hasn't build up the necessary reputation.

> And would a team with Oikawa as Setter and Ushijima as the Ace dominate the worlds?

This is just **laughable**. Even assuming that **1:** they develop to their full potential **2:** there's a massive shortage of talent that results in them being starters for the national team, that team wouldn't come anywhere close to ""dominating"" a world championship.

Nekoma will be massively crippled by the loss of Kuroo, who will be replaced by Inuoka, while also getting a big upgrade with Bokuto replacing Yamamoto.

I think you are massively overexaggerating. What are you basing this on?

> I think most people agree that Semi is a better setter

Yes, it's been told in the story that Semi has better overall individual ability than Shirabu, so it's pretty-much canon.

> Would it be as widely agreed that Shiratorizawa would have won if Semi had been their main setter

I massively doubt it. There are good reasons Washio chose Shirabu over Semi.

>His serves are great

Maybe not ""great"" but they are definitely much more impactful than Shirabu's.

>his few sets he made were of a way higher caliber than Shirabu's (see his attack feint into set)

Way too small of a sample size to draw certain conclusions. Pinch servers are *meant* to shake things up, we don't know if he'd be able to pull off such moves with consistency. Also, official stats tell us that his technique and game sense are both inferior to Shirabu's.

> The strength that they attributed to Shirabu was that he was willing to relentlessly give the ball to Ushijima, and use him to his maximal extent.

That's a massive oversimplification. Based on the information we have available, we can conclude that Shirabu is more consistent, more technically skilled, and more intelligent than Semi.

> I think that this is short-sighted, because not only would Semi have been capable of doing the same thing

Semi isn't Shirabu +1. He can't do the same things Shirabu in addition to being better in other aspects.

> He also would have been able to vary up his attacks more effectively, which could have thrown off Karasuno when they adapted their defense so specifically for Ushiwaka

Variety isn't necessarily a good thing. Shiratorizawa are placing so much emphasis on Ushijima because that's the best strategy for them. Introducing more variety would cause them to perform worse, not better.

Some closing notes from me: the things Semi is actual better at compared to Shirabu are physical condition, defensive capabilities, and serves.

**SCENARIO 2:** Sugawara is far more likely to have an instant impact due to his specialization as a pinch server, meaning Fukurodani will likely win the first set. However, Karasuno still has Kageyama as their setter, while Fukurodani will have to use their substitute setter, whoever that is. Therefore, even though Fukurodani somehow managed to bring a set to a deuce, I give Karasuno better chances of securing an overall win. **Karasuno 7/10**

**SCENARIO 3:**

Fukurodani doesn't really have a ""rowdy kouhai"" problem. Sugawara's main concern will be Bokuto's antics, and he's certainly not to going to handle them as well as Akaashi does. On the other hand, Akaashi won't really contribute to getting Karasuno's underclassmen in line. Overall, both will drop in effectiveness, but I'm giving a **slight edge to Sugawara**.",2,False

e0gsj7n,haikyuu,">**no Wakunan on the Miyagi team**

Consider me massively disappointed. Anyway, let's create a lineup for each team.

#TEAM A:

**Setter:** The #1 choice is obviously **Oikawa**. But, if we are assuming that he will refuse to play alongside Ushijima, then the next best available pick is Semi.

**M. Blockers:** There's only 3 choices, and ultimately **Tendo** and **Matsukawa** both have more individual ability than Kamasaki.

**W. Spikers:** Obviously, one of the spots goes to **Ushijima**. As for the other two, there's real competition. I'd give one of them to Nakashima if he wasn't left out, but since he's not available, I think the ones with the most individual ability remaining are **Iwaizumi** and **Asahi**.

**Libero:** There's no libero in the team, so I'm giving the spot to **Sawamura**, the best receiver out of those left.


#TEAM B:

**Setter:** The only setter in the team is **Sakishima**, so he's in by default.

**M. Blockers:** Once again, only 3 choices available. The easy pick is **Kuroo**. As for Washio vs Oomimi, I judge **Washio** to be better.

**W. Spikers:** Two very capable available in **Bokuto** and **Ojiro**, although the former's inconsistency might prove to be a problem. As for the last one, it's an extremely close call but I'm going to go with **Konoha**, who I believe has slightly more ability than players such as Kita and Daisho.

**Libero:** Tough choice between the two players available but I believe **Yaku** to be the better pick.

#VERDICT:

Team A has a significantly better setter. The middle blockers are of about the same ability, with maybe Team A having a slight edge. The opposite holds true for the wing spikers. Finally, Team B has a better libero.

The teams are extremely close in ability. Also, each of them has a major internal problem: the Oikawa - Ushijima pair and Bokuto's mental state. If one of them can take care of their issue, they will have an advantage. Otherwise, **games are split**.",3,False

Kenma relies on a very specific gameplan to he perform to his capabilities, a gameplan which Karasuno does not use.

dzkk9nb,haikyuu,"#SCENARIO 1:

First of all, let's establish a lineup for each team.

#**Team A:**

**Setter:** 

We only have two choices, and **Akaashi** is a far better choice than Sugawara, so he gets the spot. 

**Wing Spikers:** 

There's competition here. First of all, I pick **Bokuto**, not only because he's the most capable individually but also because we have Akaashi as the setter, which means the team will be better-equipped to handle his mental issues. There are many viable choices for the other two spots: Asahi, Futakuchi, Kunimi, Iwaizumi, and Daichi. Out of these, the one who are most individually capable are Asahi and Iwaizumi. **Asahi** gets the spot, and while I am worried about using **Iwaizumi** without having him paired with Oikawa, I still believe he's the best choice left.

**Middle Blockers:**

This is actually a problem cause we only have one, **Tsukishima**. I'm giving the second spot to **Futakuchi** because it seems to me he can handle the duties of a middle blocker better than the other choices.

**Libero:**

 The only choice is **Nishinoya**, but he's the best anyway.

**Staff:**

Easy choices: **Takeda** as advisor, **Yachi** as manager, and **Ukai Sr.** as coach. Let's also throw in **Akiteru** and **Saeko** for general support.

#**Team B:**

**Setter:** 

We have the best high schooler in Japan available, so obviously **Miya Atsumu** gets the spot.

**Wing Spikers:** Obviously, I am picking **Ushijima**. As for the other two spots, I'm not just considering the available wing spikers but Kageyama and Oikawa too, since they have the skillset needed. But I'm leaving Oikawa out since he wouldn't want to play with Ushijima. I give one spot to **Kageyama** and the other to the most individually capable out of the actual wing spikers, which I believe is **Goshiki**.


**Middle Blockers:** Very easy picks: **Kuroo** and **Tendou** are better than Hinata and immensely better than Yamaguchi, who is a middle blocker in name only.

**Libero:** Only one option, but it's a very good one. **Yaku**.


**Staff:** Just one staff member: **Ukai Jr.** as coach.

#Verdict:

Team B is considerably better. Their setter and their middle blockers are both noticeably better, while the wing spikers and libero are approximately even between the teams. The only real advantage of Team A is their far better staff team, but since this is going to be just one match, it's not going to have a major impact. **Team B wins 7/10 times.**

#Scenario B:

Seems pretty clear to me than **Team A** takes this one. They have more big guys in general and even some of the people who have been acknowledged as big eaters, like Nishinoya and Daichi.

#Scenario C:

No idea about the cultural festival, but as for who would win in a popularity contest, I'm leaning towards **Team B**. They have more people who seem like they would be popular, Miya Atsumu and Oikawa in particular.",1,False

dz5c3df,melodicdeathmetal,"Melodic death metal started out as a blend of death metal and heavy metal. The “melodic” aspect is from heavy metal and results in things like more harmonic guitar play and faster riffs compared to raw death metal, but it also maintains many raw death metal elements such as growling (occasionally accompanied by clean vocals), overall harsh sound and double-bass drumming. As years went by, there was diversification. Putting emphasis on the melodic aspect while downplaying the raw death metal elements also became commonplace, resulting in music that was more flamboyant and less extreme. 

Progressive metal is a different thing, although it's not uncommon to mistake progressive death with melodic death. After all, progressive metal can be quite melodic too. Some of the most common traits of progressive metal tracks are uncommon and dynamic time signatures, lengthy instrumental passages, and highly complex and technical play. Drums in particular tend to be quite challenging when it comes to the shifting time signatures. The sound is generally guitar-driven, but it is not uncommon to find keyboards and even symphonic elements. 

Gojira is progressive death. Mastodon is progressive sludge. Children of Bodom is a good example of what some people call ""modern"" melodic death: smaller parts for the death metal elements and partial or complete replacement of heavy metal elements with power metal elements. But Children of Bodom also incorporates major neoclassical elements, so they are not ""pure"" melodic death.

**Wing Spikers:** The one undisputed choice is **Terushima**. The other two spots are open for Kyotani, Katsumichi, and Rintaro. Kyotani is better than either Katsumichi or Rintaro, but he's wildly inconsistent. Because of that, I'm leaving him on the best and giving the spots to **Katsumichi** and **Rintaro**.

#**Team B:**

**Setter:** The only actual setter in the squad is **Kenma**, so he gets the spot by default.

**Libero:** There's no competition here, **Nishinoya** is better than Akiu by a large margin.

**Middle blockers:** The only middle blockers on the team are **Aone** and **Narita**, so they get the spots.

**Wing Spikers:** No other position in this prompt is so contested, with 8 players trying to claim 3 spots. However, the choices are actually quite easy to make. There are three players who stand out in ability: **Tanaka**, **Futakuchi**, and **Fukunaga**.

#**The verdict:**

Let's do a piece-by piece comparison.

**Setter:** Although Kenma is better on the mental aspects and their technique is similar, Akaashi is in far better physical shape. In addition, Kenma relies on his teammates on Nekoma to make up for his weakness, something which will not be possible to the same extent in this team. **Akaashi** takes this matchup.

**Libero:** Nishinoya is better overall, Watari is slightly better at providing an offesive presence but Nishinoya is just far ahead in everything else. **Nishinoya** takes this matchup.

**Middle blockers:** Tough one. Aone is a bit better than Kawanishi, but he's used to a very specific and organized way of blocking. Narita and Nobuyoshi are of approximately the same ability. Ultimately, I'd say this matchup is a **tie**.

**Wing Spikers:** Overall, Tanaka, Futakuchi, and Fukunaga are considerably more capable than Terushima, Katsumichi and Rintaro. **Tanaka, Futakuchi, and Fukunaga** take this matchup.

Overall, **Team B is decently stronger and I'd expect them to win 7/10 3-set matches**. However, 5-set matches are a different story. Team B only one has one setter, Kenma, and he is notorious for having poor stamina. For that reason, I believe **5-set matches would go around 50-50**.

I'm choosing the spring national tournament over the inter-high because we have more information about it.

Oikawa actually already has a decent nationwide reputation, since we see him being featured in what appears to be a national volleyball magazine, despite not having played in a national tournament. From that, we can reasonably conclude that Oikawa is already recognized as one of the best players who hasn't played in nationals.

There would definitely be some hype for Seijoh finally breaking Shiratorizawa's hold on Miyagi. After all, Shiratorizawa is considered to be one of the strongest teams in the nations. If I'm not mistaken, before the inter-high regional qualifiers they were said to be Top 8 nationwide. As the team's captain and most capable player, Oikawa's repuration would definitely be improved to a degree just through that. However, in the actual tournament, [Manga Spoilers](#s ""Seijoh would almost certainly lose to Inarizaki in the second round.

To start off, he has basically no big weakness. His weakest point is his physique, which, although weak compared to other top players, is still decent overall and well-rounded with no holes. When it comes to physical and mental ability, he really is top-notch. In the technical aspect: his blocking is superb, his receives are very good, his serving can pose a threat, and his spikes and overhands are not bad. In the mental aspect, he displays great on-pitch intelligence and composure. Nekoma's playstyle emphasizes teamwork and so Kuroo might seem like just one of the machine's cogs at times (after all, Nekoma puts their focus on Kenma), but he's the most individually capable player in the team.

dx3q83s,haikyuu,"Loving these threads so far. Here's my in-depth analysis.

#**SCENARIO 1:**

Let's rearrange the players into an actual lineup instead of their usual positions and then do individual comparisons.

#**Team A:** 

Although he can be useful in other positions too, **Kageyama** gets to keep the setter spot so that he can be as efficient as possible and hopefully carry everyone else. 

**Tsukishima** remains as middle blocker since **1:** he's the second most capable player in the team **2:** his skillset is far less useful in other positions.

There's no reason for **Sakunami** to switch, so he remains the libero.

Although Hyakuzawa switching to middle blocker isn't unreasonable, ultimately remaining a wing spiker appears to be the better choice. He has had some training as an opposite hitter (wing spiker opposite to the setter) and this team has a shortage of wing spikers anyway.

Speaking of wing spiker shortages, **Hinata** switches to cover for them. His partnership with Kageyama isn't affected and he relies more on physical and mental attributes anyway, so the difference in technical attributes needed between the positions won't affect him as much.

**Koganegawa** can't remain the setter since the spot is occupied Kageyama. He switches to middle blocker because it is a better fit for him, since it places a bigger emphasis on his good physical attributes that his terrible technique.

Finally, **Yamaguchi**. He has no particular skillset (well rounded. but weak) and his only asset is his serve, so it doesn't really matter what position he's going to play. For that reason, he switches to wing spiker in order to fill the last spot.

**Wing spikers:** Hinata, Hyakuzawa, Yamaguchi

**Middle blockers:** Tsukishima, Koganegawa

**Setter:** Kageyama

**Libero:** Sakunami

#**Team B:**

Team B doesn't have a setter, so someone needs to fill in. The one better suited is **Kunimi**, he's very intelligent and posseses decent setting technique. 

**Goshiki** keeps his position as wing spiker, he has no reason to change when there is a shortage of players in the position.

**Inuoka** simply lacks the technical ability to properly execute his duties as a wing spiker, so he remains a middle blocker.

**Shibayama** doesn't have a reason to switch, so he remains the libero.

Although normally a middle blocker, **Kindaichi** is decently well-rounded, and as such switches to wing spiker in order to fill one of the open positions.

**Lev** and **Onaga** are left: one gets to remain a middle blocker while the other must switch to wing spiker. Seeing how highly unlikely it is that Lev will be able to properly work with a setter other than Kenma, he's the one who switches, despite his massive weaknesses that will hinder him greatly, such as lack of technical ability.

**Wing spikers:** Goshiki, Kindaichi, Lev

**Middle blockers:** Inuoka, Onaga

**Setter:** Kunimi

**Libero:** Shibayama

#**Comparison:**

**Wing spikers:** Team B has both the strongest by far and weakest by far wing spikers, Goshiki and Lev respectively. Team A is less extreme, sitting in the middle. Overall I'd give a small edge to Team A, but since Team B has the two extremes, a strong performance from them could prove particularly impactful.

**Middle blockers:** This time it's Team A who has the extremes, as Tsukishima and Koganegawa are the best and worst middle blockers in the game respectively. Team B gets a small advantage because both of their middle blockers are in their natural position.

**Setter:** Kageyama is clearly the better setter by far. Not only that, but he already has chemistry with some of the people in his team, Hinata in particular. Kunimi is just a fill-in and will mostl likely do an ok job, but he just can't compare to Kageyama.

**Libero:** Sakunami is somewhat better than Shibayama, though the difference isn't large. He has displayed more technical ability and mental toughness.

#**The verdict:**

Team A wins. Their selection of players is far more varied in ability and flexible, allowing them to produce a good lineup that retains its individual strong points without having any major weakness. By comparison, Team B is forced to dillute its strong points and put players in positions they do not possess the appropriate skillset for. They cannot fight on even ground and need to hope for a few individual miracles in order to end up winning.

#**Simulated game:**

**Set 1:** Team A starts out strong. Kageyama uses the combined threat of Hinata and Hyakuzawa to confuse the enemy defense. Inuoka ends up marking Hinata 1v1 but is overwhelmed and can't stop him. Team B's defense is further burdened by Kageyama's and Yamaguchi's serves, since Goshiki is the only one that can hold his own against them. Tsukishima does a good job of containing the enemy offensive movements, reliably blocking quick attacks. Ultimately, the only Team B member with a major impact is Goshiki, and Team A wins comfortably.

**Set 2:** The situation changes somewhat. Inuoka has now adapted to Hinata and can fight him on even footing. Kunimi gives better guidance to his team, instructing them on how to deal with Hyakuzawa's spikes. This significantly reduces the success rate of Team A's offense, leading Kageyama to add more variety by attempting quick attacks with Tsukishima more often. Although they fare considerably better, Team B still ends up losing, in major part due to their inability to receive enemy serves reliably.

**Set 3:** Kageyama's increased reliance on Tsukishima poses some problems when signs of fatigue begin to show. Goshiki continues to carry Team B, causing problems to the enemy defense with his combination of strength and spiking technique while also remaining the only one capable of taking on enemy serves. Kunimi's tactics are a major asset, but his inexperience as a setter and lack of proper setting technique prevents Team B's offense from functioning properly. Kageyama orchestrates the various offensive moves of his team, and although Team B has adapted to them individually and stop them quite often, the variety leads to mind games which pose major trouble. At the end, Team A's serves wreak havoc and Team B just can't deal with them, resulting in the third set being won by Team A in similar fashion to that of the second one, and the game finishes with a score of **3 - 0**.

dwxke2n,haikyuu,"> With the Spring 2018 anime lineup starting this week, what shows are you planning to watch?

There are many shows I have in mind, but there isn't a single one I'm certain I'm going to watch immediately.

I'll definitely watch **Boku no Hero Academia 3rd Season** eventually, but not now. I want to get into Boku no Hero Academia, but because I don't want to end up binging through everything, getting attached, and then having to painfully wait for one manga chapter per week, I'm staying away for now. Since it attracts a similar audience to Haikyuu, I'm not risking checking it out yet, since it may draw me in. I'll most likely pick up the franchise in a few years or so.

The **4th season of Shokugeki no Soma** (technically second half of the third season, but whatever) will also air. I watched the first two seasons and enjoyed them, but for the time being I'm avoiding delving any further for reasons similar as with Boku no Hero Academia.

The SAO spinoff **Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online** has drawn my attention. Although I disliked the first season of Sword Art Online, I enjoyed the second, and therefore this spinoff that was derived from it seems interesting. I'll wait until it finishes airing and then watch it all in one go.

For quite some time I've been considering playing the **Steins;Gate 0** videogame. I've played the original videogame and watched the anime adaptation, enjoying both of them. Now that the anime adaptation of the sequel has arrived, I'm torn between watching it or setting it aside so I can enjoy the full experience of the videogame sometime in the future.

There's also **Persona 5 the Animation**. I've got a friendly acquaintance who loves these games, and since I can't play them myself (I don't own a PlayStation), I'll probably end up watching this adaptation. Like the SAO spinoff, I intend to wait until it finishes airing and then binge it.

dvoj9e1,history,"> And if someone can explain to me >with certainty< how the Persians were inept enough to lose the Battle of Marathon (which wasn't exactly a crushing defeat but shouldn't have gone the way it did), that'd be great.

Here's an explanation. Obviously, since the battle is so old and the sources conflict, we most likely will never know exactly what happened. What I'm posting is one of the main assumptions.

The Persians landed on Marathon (around 40 km from Athens) and disembarked. The Athenians positioned their forces to cut off their land escape. Seeing the Athenian forces there, the Persian command realized that Athens was left undefended. They began the process of re-embarking their cavalry on the ships so that they could send them to attack Athens directly while the forces of the Persian forces kept the Athenian army pinned at Marathon. This process was very time-consuming, and once the Athenians realized  what was happening, they decided to attack. It was a good time for them to do so, since the Persian cavalry was unavailable.

The Athenian formation had more troops on the flanks than the center. They marched towards the Persian forces, and when they were close enough, charged at them. Their heavy armor gave them good protection against the Persian missile troops, which were a major aspect of their army. The heavily-armed Athenian infantry proved far more capable in close combat than the Persian light troops. Although the Persians managed to hold out the center due to their massive numerical advantage, their flanks were routed and the Athenian army began surrounding the Persian forces, which broke their formation and began fleeing. The Athenians chased them all the way to the sea and killed a lot, although nearly all of the Persians that made it to the ships escaped.",2,False

So, before deciding which of the current first years would make a better captain, we need to determine exactly what a captain's responsibilities are and what characteristics he must posses.

The captain must lead and motivate the other players, be a role model for them, and also provide a communicational link between the players and the coaching staff when needed. Other stuff the captain should be doing are resolving problems between players and helping new players settle into the club.

The captain should be a regular, but besides that, he should also be a good player. There will be more respect for a captain who's also a good player. A regular on the verge of losing his regular spot isn't really suitable for a captain. It's easier for the captain to motivate players when he pulls his weight on the court. That means that besides being a good player overall, the captain must also actually give a good example by being determined, brave, hard working, and working well with the other players. If he does the above, the rest of the players will follow, and the team will function better.

The captain should have a good personality. But besides being good overall, that personality should also be at least a decent match for that of the general personality of the team. Although the captain can motivate the rest of the players to follow his lead, if the difference is too big, there's going to be problems. For example, an ambitious captain isn't fit to lead a team of unambitious players, as there will be conflict.

Finally, age. Especially considering the fact that Haikyuu is set in Japan, being older means the captain will be more respected. Also, he's going to have more experience. But since we are talking about people of the same age, it doesn't matter in this case.

Anyway, based on the above, it's practically impossible to make a good choice on captain for two years later. Personalities and ability change, and in this age, they change a lot. We can't know how any of them will be like in 2 years.

Because of that, the more levels you get in your starting class, the less (fewer?) levels you can get in your Jedi class. Obviously, the starting class and the Jedi class are very different, so depending on how you split the levels, your character is going to change.

I can't say I'm an expert on when to switch, but here are some suggestions which I hope more technically knowledgeable players will back up. First, you can just not level up your starting class at all, besides the mandatory level up in the tutorial. That way, you'll be Level 2 when you reach Dantooine and able to put up to 18 levels in your Jedi class. Other option is to level up your starting class to Level 5, because, if I'm not misremebering, that's the point you get some useful feats, and then you'll be able to put up to 15 levels in your Jedi class. Finally, you can just do whatever the fuck you want. It's not optimal, but maybe you just don't want to bother with all this.",22,False
