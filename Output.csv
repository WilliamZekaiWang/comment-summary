His actions have no negative presence in the lore or game beyond the hearsay of the Blades. He’s basically a non-entity in the local lore save for his gifting the ability of the voice to the nords alongside Kyne, when realistically, if his crimes were so heinous that they are still remembered today, why is it that not a single historical record, ballad, etc exists of them?

If they really wanted to make it an interesting choice, they could have done something like have the Blades point you to a Nordic ruin absolutely chock-full of children’s skeletons that have dragon-fire scorch marks everywhere around them, have a few ancient journals laying around that go something like: “We have angered Alduin, and Paarthurnax has been spotted in the area, so we are leaving the sick, elderly and those too young to fight in here while we try and negotiate with the dragon priests; still, I am fearful- Paarthurnax’s cruelty is infamous, he has slaughtered countless innocents on Alduin’s orders, are we to be the next?” …And let the Dragonborn connect the dots.

Then, they could even have optionally brought up that Partysnax could just be biding his time until TLD dies of old age to conquer the world unopposed.

…But they don’t do either of those things.

Meanwhile, Partysnax has been peacefully chilling on a mountain for literally thousands of years, and the only time that we know of that he has left said mountain was to visit and comfort a dragon that had literally gone insane from his cruel treatment at the hands of the mortals that Partysnax had helped save.

As the sickness continues to progress, they could have leaned even more into the horror side of the game by throwing in audio/visual hallucinations and the like, mesmer style, from the mutations doing weird stuff to your nervous system that could even have fleshed out Ryley’s character/how the stress of the situation could have been weighing on him.

And if you let it get to the last stage, you could get a non-standard game over.

They could even have done some more stuff with the empress; as-is, she only contacts you three times before you meet her, but she could done stuff to help Ryley with that gameplay system by, say, taking a page from the mesmer’s book and guiding the camera toward nearby enzyme peepers if there are no predators nearby, or even have them swim up to him if he’s past a certain stage of sickness.",2,True

…People could still die, but they just got sent to the erdtree to be reincarnated in an endless, hellish loop. But that isn’t Death with a capital D, as it is used in-game to refer to DD. It was death, but not Death, if that makes sense. It’s like how people use a capital G to refer to the specific God of Christianity, instead of a lowercase g to refer to any given god of any religion.

Look at the way it’s phrased in the description:

“The Golden Order was created by confining Destined *D*eath. Thus, this new Order will be one of *D*eath restored.”

You’re not restoring death, you’re specifically “restoring *Death*” with a capital D, so as to specify it as *Destined* Death as used in the previous sentence.

And the word “restored” means, well… to restore. To revert it to the way it was before, not change it into something new.

If they wanted to indicate that the rune would be warping DD to make everyone into zombies or whatever, they would have used a different way of phrasing it- “Death transfigured,” “Death reshaped,” “Death that has been changed, not specifically “restored,” so it instead just results in turning people into zombies.”

…As a result, Occam’s Razor is still kinda making me lean towards the Rune of the Death Prince’s item description *uniquely* stating that it will restore Death among all mending runes being meant to be taken as it somehow, some way, being the only one to fully restore Destined Death as it once was, likely via his and Ranni’s connection to the shards of the rune of death that were used to kill him in the first place.",1,True

…I’m currently 41k words into writing a sci-fi space opera type novel, and one of the alien species in question has a symbiotic relationship with algae it keeps in transparent growths in its bug-like chitin on their torsos that was inspired by [the Leaf Sheep sea slug](https://i.redd.it/zp0wte7md4a31.jpg), a creature that uses the chloroplasts it harvests from the algae it eats to photosynthesize for it.

Then I thought, “why not make the algae [bioluminescent,](https://serious-science.org/bioluminescent-algae-6827) and connect it to their nervous systems so it changes color depending on their current emotion as an adaptation for better socializing, because their chitin is too rigid for complex facial expression for the purposes of social cues and communication?”

Then I thought “hmm, how would that affect their culture?” 

And as a result, it turns out none of them wear shirts (Not for pointless booba fanservice; both sexes look pretty much identical), because they just see wearing shirts that aren’t necessary for the weather or whatever as the equivalent of putting on a balaclava before you walk into a bank; aka, VERY sketchy, like you have something to hide.

iwzam1o,HolUp,"There are several varieties of bots designed to farm karma; they do this in order to A: make the account look legit and B: in order to bypass the minimum karma requirements that several subreddits have in place to prevent bots.

These accounts are usually sold later and/or used for shitty purposes; for example, phishing scams are used to try and steal people’s identity, such as via those annoying t-shirt/art print spam posts you may have noticed from time to time where there’s always a “helpful” link to a sketchy 3rd party website in the post itself or in the comments where you can “buy” the merch in question.

…Luckily, it’s pretty easy to learn the patterns these comment bots follow if you pay attention.

**USERNAME**

The usernames bot accounts use are almost always going to follow three formats: 

1: Two randomly generated words and a number, optionally with hyphens in between them (ex: Watering-Growth-7832/WateringGrowth7832)

2: One to two words that have been mishmashed together, occasionally with portions of the otherwise recognizable words chopped off, mixed with a few random letters at the end (ex: Platinumboahgtyvdkd)

3: a random assortment of letters with random capitalization throughout. (ex: HgjYThJsE)

**ACTIVITY/AGE**

Bot accounts are usually set to be completely inactive until a certain amount of time has passed; generally, a little over a week, or a little over a multiple of 30 days (to bypass the minimum account age requirement many subreddits use to help lessen bot posts).

After this arbitrary amount of time has passed, the bots will suddenly become active and comment on several different posts of different, usually completely unrelated subreddits all at once.

**THE COMMENTS**

Comment bots usually come in a few flavors: 

1: Ones that straight-up copy a portion of another person’s comment somewhere else in the thread and reply said copied comment to a top-upvotes comment or otherwise a comment near the top of the thread; these are usually easy to spot because they often lack any connection to the comment they’re replying to, and usually start halfway through a sentence.

2: Comments that are as bland and vague as possible, but agree with the top comment they are replying to and occasionally have random, extra, useless punctuation mixed in (“that seems right to me,” “Yes, I agree,,,” etc)

3: Comments that just say “Yes,” and then copy/paste the top comment they’re replying to after the word yes. (Ex: the top comment says “Bro, what?“ and the bot replies “Yes, bro what?”)

4: Comments that just copy-paste the comment they’re replying to but screw with the formatting of a single word somehow. (Ex: top comment says “Whoa, what the hell happened to her?” And the bot comment says “whoa, ^what the hell happened to her?”)

——

**WHAT TO DO IF YOU SUSPECT A COMMENTER IS A BOT**

If a comment raises your suspicions, take a brief glance at their profile before making the final call. Bots will almost always have the blank snoo template as their profile picture or an avatar with a random assortment of clothing. They also will almost always lack any sort of customization to their profile (background picture, description).

If you look at the profile and see it’s customized, you can feel reasonably certain they’re a human. Otherwise, take a cursory glance at their comment history. If the comments all follow the usual patterns I’ve described, and you’re leaning towards them not a human:

Y'ggdrasog swore under his breath, before remembering himself and having the fabricator print out a few tissues for his guest. As he passed them to her, he broke the silence.

""If this is too painful for you, I don't blame you. Stop whenever you feel like it, my curiosity isn't worth causing you pain.""

Kate wiped away the tears once more, shaking her head as she did.

""No. No, I'm- It's a relief, I think, to talk about this.""

She was silent for a few moments before chuckling and continuing.

""...Even if my surrogate therapist has a damn-near unpronounceable name and looks like a 7-foot-tall cross between a praying mantis and a bipedal, glowing chameleon.""

Y'ggdrasog was silent for a moment before leaning forward, clutching the table and making strange noises as his bioluminescence floundered about for a bit before landing on sunflower yellow and staying there for several seconds.

Kate was worried for a moment before realizing he was laughing. It was an odd sound, like sandpaper on stone mixed with something akin to a windchime in hurricane winds. Upon realizing this, she gave a genuine smile for the first time in days, and giggled with him.

He wiped away a green teardrop from his eye and spoke.

""Ahaha, I needed that after all this horrific talk. ...But like I said, if this is too much for you-""

Her smile faded, as quickly as it came.

""Don't. I- I'm fine, ok? Don't worry about me.""

He knew Kate was lying. She knew that he knew. But she pressed on regardless.

""...What hurt the most was that no one stood up for me. The cousins were silent whenever my father raised his voice. When I looked to mom, she... she just turned her head. Couldn't meet my gaze. They just let him do it. Let me be his chew toy, his verbal punching bag, because they didn't want to risk gaining his ire as I had.

It came to a head on day 7, when I was going over our inventory of supplies for the 5th time in an hour. It was the only thing I could do to entertain myself besides counting the ceiling tiles. It was silent in the bunker save for my rearranging the cans and bottles in the storage closet, just barely audible clinks and scrapes, the sound of glass rattling against glass and metal sliding against wood.

I heard a roar from behind me.

""SHUT UP!""

I jumped and started to turn, but then his hands gripped my throat.

""SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUTUPSHUTUPSHUTUP!""

He was choking me from behind. My- m-my own father, trying to kill me, over a few tiny sounds.

For a few, agonizingly long seconds I was too shocked to do anything but clutch at the hands on my throat, wheezing for air, but then survival instincts took hold. I lurched forward, managing to slip out of his grip, took a desperate lungful and grabbed a glass bottle we had emptied a few days back before turning and smashing it against his face, breaking it into pieces.

He cried out in pain and clutched his face, but as I swung again he grabbed my arm with both hands and wrenched. I heard more than felt the horrific crack my bone made as it twisted into an unnatural angle, before he grabbed the bottle from me and gouged it into my now-crooked limb.

I still had some adrenaline left flowing through me, dulling the pain, and knew I had to get out of there before it faded and the pain crippled me. With my good arm I punched him in the face as hard as I could and ran past him as he clutched at the broken cartilage that was once his nose.

As I ran past my cousins, my mom, it felt like time slowed. I looked at them, and their expressions... not one had so much as stood up to help me, to investigate what the noise and fuss was about, to even look at me. They just... j-just didn't care, as long as it wasn't them in his crosshairs.""

Kate wiped away the tears from her face once more, before glancing out the viewport at the burning planet below.

""I escaped the bunker, heedless of radiation or other possible dangers- they certainly couldn't be worse than the hell I just escaped- and ran as far as I could before the pain overwhelmed me. I just sat in a ditch about 5 miles down the road from the farm, brain fogged- partly by the pain, but mostly by the grief. The grief of a daughter who lost her father. The man I once knew, I once loved, that took me to ballgames for my birthdays, who watched my god-awful poetry recitals in high school, who hugged me as I got my bachelor's diploma...""

The tears stopped, and her expression was one of dull, exhausted sorrow.

""...That man is dead. He was dead the minute he set foot in that precious fucking bunker of his.""

She set down her (now mangled from clenching so hard) spoon and stared into the distance for a while before continuing.

""I passed out at some point. Then I woke up in a dark room with an alien standing over me, and... well. You know the rest.""

Y'ggdrasog leaned back against the wall for support, his legs feeling like jelly. This was... so much worse than anything he had imagined. And his heart broke at what he had to say next.

""I... ...I hate myself for this, but- look. Standard protocol for injured civilians in a first contact scenario is to patch them up, then leave them with a relative, if possible-""

She stared at him for a moment with the eyes of one who has known far too much suffering for her youth, and responded in the hollow, dead voice of one who cared not what happened to her anymore.

""If that's true, you may as well have let the infection kill me.""

A flurry of colors glowed across his face, as he started and faltered sentence after sentence.

""I... I can't- Look, it- I mean... I- I have no choice but to- I'd be risking-""

Suddenly, his eyes went wide and he glowed a pure white.

""Wait... That just might- WAIT! Hold on, I need to check- just give me a second-""

Kate flinched from the sudden movement as he dived for a holo-tablet sitting nearby.

""What are you doing?!""

Y'ggdrasog ignored her, concentrating on scrolling through what looked to be some sort of massive form, chock full of bulleted lists and footnotes.

""...I swear to god, if you're- I dunno, doing your taxes or something right now while I'm about to get sent back down to what will almost certainly be my ***death***, I WILL-""

""YES!"" Y'ggdrasog said, shoving the tablet into her good hand. ""LOOK HERE!""

She frowned at the unfamiliar symbols. ""I... I can't read this, it's just a bunch of squiggles and weird shapes.""

""What? ...Oh spirits above, I'm sorry, I forgot, you're not- no implant for-""

Kate pinched the bridge of her nose, tossing the tablet back to him as he continued to stammer.

""You'd better start explaining real fast or I'll- I'll... ...When I think of something sufficiently bad, I'll DO IT!"" she finished lamely.

He was silent for a moment, glowing bright blue with his head cocked to the side before composing himself.

""Uh- right. Um... Section 15a, subsection 45 of the 5th article-""

""Skip the legalese and get to the point.""

""...When participating in an uplifting, a member of the uplifting team in question is allowed to choose between a credit-bonus or a choice piece of paraphernalia from the race in question, up to and including pets.""

"".....I'm not following.""

""It doesn't have a hard definition for what constitutes a pet! It just says ""a living being of your choice that you have formed an emotional attachment to, and that you are equipped to handle, house, and provide care to.""

"".......If you're suggesting what I think you're suggesting-""

Y'ggdrasog's mandibles clacked together decisively.

""You won't have to go back.""

She stared at him for a moment, face blank, as he continued to babble about how no, he didn't see her as his lesser, this was just to keep her safe, she'd be free to leave at any time and would have equal rights to any other individual in the collective and so on, his voice fading into the background as the most important part repeated over and over in her head.

*You won't have to go back.*

Her eyes filled with tears and she interrupted his rambling by flinging her good arm around him to pull him into a tight hug, starting to sob again. Muffled by his carapace-covered chest came two words that held the weight of the world in them.

“…Thank you...""

As the shock of the moment wore off, he smiled, closing his eyes and gently returning the hug, glowing a dull pink as he did so.

""...My pleasure.""",43,True
ivtiavt,humansarespaceorcs,"PART 2

Believe it or not, there are actually VERY extensive protocols in place when making first contact with a new sapient race. …Granted, the various races that make up the Ul’dril Galactic Collective only had to pull that set of protocols out and dust it off once every couple millennia or so, but they’re there. And in the case of the discovery of Earth and the humans upon it, they followed them to the letter.

To summarize said protocols completely would take several hours, but the most important directives were as follows:

1: Discreetly monitor the species for a while so as to A: determine their general behavioral patterns and physiology, and B: let the auto-translator AI algorithms pull as much language data as possible to generate an accurate language package (no one wanted to say “where’s the restroom” when meaning to say “we come in peace” like what infamously happened when the Jazuli joined the collective due to the scout ships rushing things).

Only upon completion of a comprehensive language platform for all native languages of the population would contact be established, broadcasting a global message of peace and a desire for peaceful contact in as many languages as is feasible.

2: During initial, first-five-year interactions, under NO circumstances resort to any violence whatsoever save for disabling enemy weapons if under attack in a manner that does not harm those wielding them. Anyone found guilty of deliberately harming a member of a first contact species in a manner that isn’t self-defense within the first 50 years will be summarily executed, and the remains of the guilty presented to the species in question to show that the violent individual was an outlier, nothing more. …That last bit is rather draconian, yes, but “first impressions” and all that.

3: If the species agrees to join the Collective, uplift the species to the current levels of technology that the rest of the galactic collective uses as soon as is reasonable, so as to provide a post-scarcity way of life for all sapient species. This serves to reduce the probability of conflict over such petty things as physical resources or advanced blueprints/technology.

When the first contact of humanity finally commenced and the broadcast went out to Earth, all individuals of the Collective involved on the project waited with excitement and baited breath.

…That excitement slowly turned to horror as the helpless onlookers saw the world below them almost immediately fall into complete chaos.

**---------**

Despite what had transpired regarding fixing her up, it still took several hours of rest, double that for time to process her situation, and quite a bit of gentle prodding and coaxing before Kate was convinced she was safe enough to follow Y'ggrasog to eat at a proper dining table instead of in her impromptu hidey-hole. She sat across from him, slowly eating some fabricated oatmeal, as he simply watched and waited, before finally feeling comfortable enough to break the silence.

""Do you want to talk about it now? I mean, regarding what you said about your family?""

He saw her grip on the newly-fabricated spoon tighten until her knuckles turned bone-white. There was an awkward silence for a few moments.

""...I understand if it's an uncomfortable subject, I was just-""

""No, it's- it's fine. I'm just still reeling at- well. All of this. Aliens. Spaceships. ...The world going mad.""

""What was your experience like on the ground? I'm afraid the view from a spacecraft is rather broad, but shallow. And I'm curious; I've seen several, almost blinding-white flashes dotting the atmosphere, but whenever I inquire about it to my superiors they just give me an odd look and ignore the question. ...What happened?""

She sighed. ""A bunch of sick old men afraid of change, desperately clinging to what little power they have, and simultaneously deciding it was high time that the world committed suicide, that's what that was. Israel, Pakistan, the USA, Russia, China- countless others, I'm sure, but those are the ones that launched the most ICBM's at each other. All these old, pointless grudges flaring up at once during the panic, over events that took place generations ago.""

""Icy... beans? That didn't translate well-""

""Nuclear warheads. Thousands of them.""

Y'ggrasog's mandibles dropped open, his bioluminescence going  through the entire rainbow within seconds before settling on a dull beige.

""I- ................oh.""

""...Yeah...""

""I... I am so, so very sorry. I- we had no idea this would lead to-""

""Don't apologize for humans fucking themselves over. It's in our nature. ...But I'm getting off topic. You wanted to know about this...""

Kate motioned down to her broken arm. There were a few moments of silence, then Kate gave a wry smile.

""Ironically, when the panic started, my father's only reaction was feeling very, very validated. He was a ""prepper."" Built a lead-lined bunker on our farm in rural Montana, constantly kept it stocked with enough rations and water to last us multiple years. Constantly mocked about it by what few neighbors we had in the area and me most of all- I thought it was an enormous waste of time and money that we could put into the rest of the farm instead. ...But I suppose it paid off in the end. He rushed us all down there as soon as the news reports came in.

We had only been down there a few hours when the radio updates stopped. All the EMPs from the nukes fried the radio stations' ability to send out information. Until they could be repaired, all we had was silence, and there certainly weren't any electronic shops still open to fix the issue. We were just... alone. My father, mother, a couple older cousins that were visiting at the time, and me. All with nothing but our own company to entertain ourselves with.

...All the research he'd done, all the food and water and air filters he'd stocked, but he failed to account for one thing; morale. He didn't pack so much as a card game down there, and the boredom kicked in sooner rather than later. We were all bored, of course, but- I dunno, it just... affected my father differently than the rest.

Boredom turned to spite, then anger... and then hate, on the 5th day. He just kept verbally *unloading* on me at random, about how he was right all this time, about how I was wrong to doubt him for building that bunker, that I was an ungrateful little bitch, and- a-and that-""

A tear dripped from the tip of her nose, fizzling against the nanobots as it landed on her arm.

""...And that I didn't deserve to be in there with the rest of them.""

ivti462,humansarespaceorcs,"(This is a 3-part response I made to a similar prompt on r/WritingPrompts)

Y’ggrasog’s friends often joked that he was damn near emotionless. He had seen a lot in his life as a spacer. Many such things were wondrous. He had seen stars go supernova, space dust form beautiful clouds thousands of miles wide, and caught the frosted trails of comets slinging close enough to a star to off-gas their icy payloads.

…But many, many more such things were horrible, tragic, and stark reminders of the fragility of life. He had seen crewmates suffer catastrophic decompression due to shoddy suits, and others die of radiation poisoning after the idiot navigator had added a couple more zeroes than necessary when calculating how far from a star they could safely travel.

Throughout all of this, he took it upon himself to remain stoic, to keep going, no matter how much he wanted to give up. It took a lot to so much as phase him.

…And as he watched the pitiful creature before him, he was struggling to maintain the titanic willpower required to not start ugly-crying on the spot.

The human (female, in her mid-20s by the looks of it based off his limited knowledge of their biology) had long since gotten over the initial surprise upon realizing she had been abducted from her homeworld, but was now curled into a ball in the corner of the room where she had constructed a farcical barricade out of whatever was nearby. Cushions, pillows, a shelving unit, a few thermal blankets here and there. He could see through the shadows she clung to that her arm was bleeding, her unfocused, bloodshot eyes and rose-colored cheeks were wet, her chest heaving as she went from panicked hyperventilating to quiet sobs to desperate pleading to no one in particular in a voice rendered hoarse from the initial screaming which had (thankfully) stopped a few minutes hence.

“Please oh please d-don’t let me die here I don’t want to die I don’t want to die I’m n-not ready to die oh god please someone help me I don’t want to-“

He cleared his throat, the sudden noise causing her to flinch and clutch her injured arm tighter than before.

“…Miss, please, I have no intention of-“

“OHGODPLEASEDON’TKILLME!”

“I- I have no intention whatsoever of causing you to come to any harm. Just…”

She stared at him for a few seconds, gaze full of sheer terror, before she screwed her eyes shut, blocking the world out.

“Please wake up please wake up this is a nightmare this has to be a fucking nightmare oh god please wake up-“

“No, miss, this… I’m afraid this is very much real.”

Her eyes flew open, staring at him, tears welling in her eyes from the recognition that he spoke truly, before burying her face in the crook of her non-injured arm and continuing to weep.

He struggled to remember the portions of intel surrounding the physiology and psychology this species possessed.

“Just… uh- take a few deep breaths. In and out, slow. Can you do that for me? Please?”

He watched as she raised her head slightly and gazed at him, her eyes wide and fearful, but as he continued to stand there, not daring to make any sudden movements, he noticed her breathing starting to slow, her shoulders relaxing a bit.

“That’s a bit better. Can… can you please tell me your name?”

She was silent for several seconds before letting out a whimpered answer so quiet his auto-translator barely picked it up.

”K-Kate…”

“Kate. Alright. …Kate, I know you’re scared, but I only want to help you.”

A few moments of silence passed, broken only by the quiet sound of Kate’s slow, ragged breaths.

“Listen to me. The only reason I brought you here is due to your current condition and the vast distance between your position at the time my sensors detected you and the closest human population center. Your appendage is bleeding and a bone is fractured quite badly. While the blood loss is not enough to kill you, the ship’s auto-doc system detected an infection growing within the wound that it calculated would kill you before you could reach aid from your own kind. I merely wish to help you before it gets any worse.”

Another minute of silence passed before she finally spoke.

“…..Ok…”

“Good. This will only take a few moments…”

Trying to move as slowly as possible, he reached up to a nearby panel on the wall and typed in a code. A small drone, about the size of a baseball, appeared from a nearby hole in the wall. He clutched it in his hand and extended it out to her, causing her to shrink back away from him.

“This is a medical droid. I’ve programmed it with all knowledge of human anatomy we’ve been able to decipher. It’s just going to administer a solution to flush the wound of contaminants and sterilize it, apply a medical gel that will bind to any damaged tissues to stop the bleeding, then install a- …hm. I suppose your race doesn’t have this tech yet… uh- just think of it as something like an advanced hybrid between a cast and prosthetic that will prevent you from accidentally injuring yourself further. All I need you to do is just uncover your arm and remain as still as possible for a bit. Ok?”

She remained motionless for a few seconds before slowly, gingerly removing the hand she had been clutching to the wound, wincing as she shifted slightly to face the droid.

It went to work, and the process was over within seconds. She gingerly poked at the metallic substance covering her arm, the fear on her face slowly being replaced by bemusement, before finally speaking.

“What… what is this stuff?”

“It’s a collection of self-sterilizing nanobots programmed to your physiology. They will adapt to any movements you make in an attempt to keep your arm as still as possible as it recovers. If you were a member of my own species the bone and tissues would already be repaired at this point, but… well, we still don’t know enough about your kind for that sort of thing to be possible yet, so we’ll just have to let the bone and tissue heal by itself.”

“…What’s your name?”

“Y’grassog.”

She sniffled before replying in almost a whisper.

“…Thank you...”

His mandibles broke into his species’ equivalent of a grin, and his bioluminescence shifted hues to show the change.

“My pleasure.”

They sat in silence for a few moments before he broke it.

“I’m going to check back in on you shortly, and in the meantime I’ll calibrate the fabricator to produce some food and drink your species can safely metabolize so we can get you fed and watered. Then we can get you back to your people-“

“NO!”

He started at the sudden noise, before the meaning of her outburst hit him.

“What… Why not? Don’t you want to see your loved ones again? Your family?”

“I… uh…”

He tilted his head to the side in confusion, and after a few seconds she continued.

“My… my family did this to me.""

ivktj6q,Eldenring,"Malenia is an empyrean who was chosen by the Two Fingers, but cursed at birth by the Outer God of Rot (or blessed, from their perspective and the perspective of those who worship said Outer God). It wishes for her to be its vassal goddess in TLB, just as Marika is the vassal of The Greater Will. Thus, she has a measure of control over being able to manifest the Scarlet Rot’s *immense* destructive power- but it came at equally immense cost to herself and those around her. She is, through no fault of her own, the eye of a storm of sorts; she corrupts and rots away all life around her, without even meaning to. Her soldiers were stricken by Scarlet Rot without her even doing anything beyond staying in their presence, and- well. Just look at what her presence (even while *comatose*) has wrought upon certain portions of the Haligtree. 

Thus, she chose to resist the Outer God’s influence as much as she can.

It has eaten away at her over the years, forcing her to live in constant agony. It even influenced her dreams, as scarlet rot causes nightmares among those who suffer it. In short, it has been doing everything it can to wear down her willpower and let it consume her, letting it take her over entirely until she’s just a rotten puppet of that Outer God, but she has resisted its influence as much as possible because she’s just *that* determined and her will is just *that* strong. Her will is even a game mechanic- her greater rune explains that her regaining health whenever she hits you is her using *sheer determination* to keep fighting you, and every hit she lands inspires that determination to rise further.

Despite having lost 3 of her 4 limbs to it, it’s implied that the growth of the rot has actually physically been slowed over time by her ironclad will to resist it spreading further. That, alongside her brother, Miquella, discovering that the application of unalloyed (aka pure) gold inhibits the influence of Outer Gods over those who use said gold. Thus, her prosthetics and armor (designed and provided to her by Miquella) are entirely made of said gold. If Millicent’s dialogue is anything to go by, said prosthetics are somehow capable of feeling and processing sensory data like touch just as the original limb itself can, meaning her legendary talent with the sword hasn’t deteriorated whatsoever with the loss of her limbs. …Speaking of her swordplay, she was trained from a young age by a master swordsman who had somehow personally fought against the Outer God of rot by sealing away a portion of its power, cutting it off from it and concentrating it into the Lake of Rot. The swordsman taught her the ways of the blade to give her something to focus on, and enable her to fight without resorting to giving in to the powers of rot that she had been “gifted” with.

…However, her willpower has limits, and if pushed far enough past them, and her will to resist the powers of the Rot gives out… well.

I usually hate colossal weapons due to how slow they are, but it’s about as fast as a greataxe, its diagonal swings are great for catching airborne enemies, and its WA is the perfect ambush attack or wake-up hit on a boss or other large enemy after you get a riposte- especially the latter, with how much hyper-armor you get. 

It even has awesome lore to go along with it; I mean shit, you’re swinging around the personal weapon of a fucking *EMPYREAN* whose sole purpose in life was to *murder all gods* in the world and go full Buffalo Bill with their remains. (#LifeGoals, amirite?)

…The only downside is the relatively high str requirement for its low strength-scaling- and even then, the low scaling is honestly a blessing in disguise. You’re already going to be breaking enemy poise and stance with ease due to it being, y’know, *a colossal sword,* so unless you ABSOLUTELY NEED to break a boss’ stance as soon as possible, you have almost no reason to two-hand it in 99% of situations due to how low of a damage boost you’ll get and the fact that the moveset is effectively identical whether one or two-handing it. 

As a result, it leaves a hand free for your seal of choice, making it essentially the perfect weapon for a faith-based spellsword playstyle that has the endurance to spare.

iudegrz,humansarespaceorcs,"As they stepped out of their starships, I almost laughed at their appearance. Soft skin, little fur save for what paltry wisps graced the top of their heads, teeth and claws that clearly had no chance of being able to pierce the flesh of even the least of the creatures of this planet, much less being of any use in combat.

I almost let my guard down- almost- and only mentally drafted three different countermeasures on how to kill them all as they approached.

They engaged in pleasantries, offered gifts, everything they could to try and get me to let my guard down. To get me to slip up, show weakness- then they would strike. …Or so I thought.

It went on for days. Every day I met with them, I grew more puzzled. When would they make their move? I would have done so by now. Perhaps they were intimidated by us? After all, the least of us were easily more than a head taller than them, and their biological gifts for the hunt, the chase, the *kill* were pathetic.

Then, on the seventh day, one finally felt brave enough to “hug” me.

I tensed up, and it felt as though time slowed; to touch another without warning outside of training and sparring was tantamount to declaring your intent to kill, and I prepared to rip them to shreds.

…But something about the sensation gave me pause. 

I could barely feel the pressure making its way through my fur to my scar-covered flesh, but it dampened my blood-rage. They were just- …*holding* me. Softly, warmly.

I was beyond confused, and asked them what in the name of the lifeblood of my ancestors they were doing. Their response only puzzled me further:

“From what we’ve seen, heard and learned- well. …Until you all trust us enough to let us rescue you from this hellhole of a world, you guys need this more than anything else we can offer.”

It was so unabashedly *strange.* To touch another, *without* meaning to kill them?

…

…And yet…

That sensation- that *feeling* was unique.

Touch.

Warmth.

Care.

Calm.

**Trust.**

It was alien- literally.

But though I didn’t know it at the time… they were right. 

We *did* need it. *I* needed it.

…There’s a saying that I only learned later was quite popular among the deathworlders of the galaxy: “you don’t know you’re a deathworlder until you’ve left home.”

In that moment, that brief moment of compassion, it allowed me that much; to leave that world- if only mentally, for a moment.

If the customs of these visitors were such- to allow themselves to be vulnerable, despite their biology, despite their weakness, despite what I had believed to be common sense…

…Did they legitimately have no ill intentions towards us?

Against my better judgement- no, not just that, against *everything* I had drilled into me for as long as I could remember- I let my guard down, and returned the “hug.” Just standing there, sharing in that gentle pressure, just appreciating that moment, one unlike anything I’d ever felt before…

It felt- …good…?

Yes.

Good…

Interacting like that with another, with no intent for violence, bloodshed, ending the lives of others… it was nice. 

It allowed my mind to relax- for just a moment- and let go of the death, the stress, the blood, the violence, the pain, the loss, the grief, the pressure, the paranoia, the anger, the bitterness, the hatred, the spite, the sadness, the *fear*- all my constant companions, kept bottled up and tucked away deep inside me. All the things that I thought kept me safe all those years.

…And then the bottle cracked.

It didn’t register when I started shaking, and I don’t remember how I ended up unable to stop violently sobbing... But the human just hugged me tighter, gently brushed their hands through my fur and softly repeated four words, over and over.

The same four words I would hear to reassure me that I was making the right choice when I signed up for the initial “galactic integration programs” they offered.

The same four words I finally realized for myself as I looked out at the world I VERY gladly left behind for the last time.

The same four words I knew the truth of when I visited some of the other homeworlds of the galaxy and realized *just* how bad we had it.

The same four words I would hear as I first met with what they called “therapists” to treat my “severe PTSD” (an apparently nigh-universal condition for those of us who originated from the homeworld).

The same four words I had to remind myself of every day afterwards when old patterns of behavior and thought popped up.

The four words I marveled at every once in a while in endless gratitude for what I later learned was the only species brave enough to so much as consider landing on our living nightmare of a world in the first place with the intent of lifting us up:

“It’s ok. You’re safe.”",396,True
iudab62,humansarespaceorcs,"When the humans first greeted us, we were beyond cautious. We, too, were what the galaxy calls “deathworlders.” …Except our case was actually far worse than theirs, if you can believe it.

We did not have the luxury of living on a world tolerant enough of us to advance our technologies nearly as fast as the humans did. I believe the farthest we got on our own was what they called “steam-power,” and even then only in VERY few of the larger settlements.

To grow up on the surface of our homeworld was to know dread at every waking moment. For what few of us were able to survive long enough that we were able to form memories, our elders taught us how to fight, how to kill. How to best make use of the spike-tipped horns evolution had granted us to fend off the beasts of the night. How to use our claws and fangs to rend the flesh of what few creatures we could consider prey instead of deadly predator.

But more important than to fight was how to think, and one thought was above all others: 

To treat every being you encounter, even your own kind, as though it would not kill you without hesitation- nay, that it was not planning on doing it at any moment- was *insanity*.

…So when the first human diplomats appeared, descending from the heavens and stepping out of their ships from the stars, we just sighed and mentally tacked on yet another threat to the pile. 

We were among the last of the settlements they approached. Despite the good tidings we heard from what few outsiders we allowed inside the 3-meter thick steel walls of our tribe’s home (barely enough to keep the night-beasts out, and worthless against the terror-beasts of the sky), we remained cautious. And when they finally approached us and made ready to greet us, and I was selected by lottery to be our tribe’s emissary… When the time came, I was ready for anything.

it7iik6,humansarespaceorcs,"The tiny, meter-tall-at-best alien slave was silent for a moment as he pondered what he had just been asked by the human in front of him, two of his clawed hands nervously wringing some of the rags that were doing their best to cover the majority of his body, while another absentmindedly grazed his slave collar.

“I… I don’t understand-”

The human in front of him casually shrugged a shoulder, the action causing a curl of her grey hair to bounce with the movement.

“What? It’s a simple question.”

She glanced away from him and pointed to the group of hogtied aliens of various species, shapes and sizes in the corner. Aliens who had- up until VERY recently- been his masters.

“…Which of their heads do you want delivered to you on a silver platter, and did you have any particular one of the bastards you want us to… *take our time* extracting said head from?”

If anything, her repeating the disturbing question with such casual nonchalance confused him even more. His six eyes narrowed.

“But- …you just bought me from them…”

“Of course I did. …Or rather, I momentarily lent them a few credits that will be back in my possession as soon as we’ve cracked the accounts of these wastes of flesh.”

She sneered in contempt at the hogtied slavers.

“You see, I and my crew here…“

She motioned to the other humans in the room who were currently pointing weapons at the bound slavers.

“We’re part of a- shall we say, *”independent sting operation”* to rid the universe of these fuckers. Most humans have a particularly acute distaste for slavers, and we’re no exception. It’s just that instead of wanting them imprisoned, we’re of the opinion that if you’re the type of person to view another sapient as property, well… No amount of jail time can “reform” someone *that* far gone.”

She spat at the feet of the closest slaver, the saliva landing with a sickening *splat* on the metal floor as she continued.

“In our eyes, the only good they’ll ever provide the galaxy is as a direct source of free-range, “volunteered” organs donated free of charge to a set of medical centers some of my colleagues have connections to that are sympathetic to our choice of “hobby.””

She turned back to the slave.

“So, again, my only question to *you* is, do any of them in particular have more coming to them than the rest before we send them to the boys in the chop shop?”

The slave was silent for a moment as he looked back and forth between his former masters and the human.

“It’s ok if you don’t-“

She fell silent as he slowly raised a trembling claw and pointed towards a pair of them, who tensed up.

“That one, wearing the grey robe; and that one, the one with the red tattoos on their face. They- t-they…”

He shuddered.

“…D-did… *things*… to some of the other slaves, the- …the younger ones… when the rest of the slavers weren’t looking. I- …t-their screams, I…”

He trailed off and closed his eyes. A tear ran down his face as he choked back a sob.

The human pursed her lips, gazing at the slavers he had pointed out with an expression that could only be described as a mask of tranquility that was doing a questionable job disguising the inferno of fury burning underneath, but her voice was soft and level as she turned back towards the trembling slave.

“I… see. …It’s ok, sweetheart; you don’t need to elaborate.”

She turned back to the pair of slavers in question, who had now been dragged aside from the rest of the prisoners by the guards.

“In that case, I think I might just… “forget” to make sure we kill them *before* the harvest process. And maybe it’ll slip my mind to remind the boys not to use some of the *duller* tools we have laying around…”

She leisurely walked over to the pair of now-terrified slavers, fruitlessly struggling against their bonds, and kneeled next to one, looking them in their horrified eyes.

“My memory is just… **agonizingly** bad sometimes, y’know?”

She smirked as their screams, muffled by the gags over their mouths, reached her ears.

“20 years of this, and I’m still not tired of that sound…”

She gestured to a few members of her crew and addressed one.

“Take them away. …Oh, and send me the recordings later; I could use a laugh.”

A sadistic smile spread across the scar-covered face of the crew member she spoke to.

“Aye, captain.”

As the still-screaming and struggling slavers were dragged away by some of the other humans, the captain turned and winked at the alien slave before her.

“Let me know if you want a copy. A little schadenfreude does wonders for the soul, especially when the bastards in question **REALLY** deserve it.”

He swallowed nervously, shuddering in revulsion.

“Uh- …t-that won’t be necessary, mistress.”

The human pursed her lips into a frown again, and he tensed up in fear, but her words and expression remained soft and kind as she spoke to him.

“Don’t call me that. God willing, you’re never going to have to call anyone “master” or “mistress” out of fear again.”

“…What do you mean?”

She cocked her head to the side.

“What do you *think* I mean? You’re free now!”

His jaw dropped open, all six of his eyes widening.

“I- I’m- I’m… wh-?”

The human reached forward toward the diminutive alien, and with practiced ease disabled the explosive-filled-collar that had been strapped to him so long ago before unclamping it and lifting it away. He raised a shaky hand and touched the strip of long-since rubbed-raw flesh on his throat that hadn’t seen light for five long, *long* years.

“I’m… f-fr- …*free*?”

The human nodded.

“You’re free, sweetheart.”

He was motionless for a few seconds before tears suddenly began streaming down his face and he pulled the human into a tight hug, his face pressed into her abdomen. The muffled sound of hysterical, relieved sobbing came from below.

The human smiled and crouched down to return the hug.

“Shhhh… there there, hun.”

She chuckled.

Y'ggdrasog swore under his breath, before remembering himself and having the fabricator print out a few tissues for his guest. As he passed them to her, he broke the silence.

""If this is too painful for you, I don't blame you. Stop whenever you feel like it, my curiosity isn't worth causing you pain.""

Kate wiped away the tears once more, shaking her head as she did.

""No. No, I'm- It's a relief, I think, to talk about this.""

She was silent for a few moments before chuckling and continuing.

""...Even if my surrogate therapist has a damn-near unpronounceable name and looks like a 7-foot-tall cross between a praying mantis and a bipedal, glowing chameleon.""

Y'ggdrasog was silent for a moment before leaning forward, clutching the table and making strange noises as his bioluminescence floundered about for a bit before landing on sunflower yellow and staying there for several seconds.

Kate was worried for a moment before realizing he was laughing. It was an odd sound, like sandpaper on stone mixed with something akin to a windchime in hurricane winds. Upon realizing this, she gave a genuine smile for the first time in days, and giggled with him.

He wiped away a green teardrop from his eye and spoke.

""Ahaha, I needed that after all this horrific talk. ...But like I said, if this is too much for you-""

Her smile faded, as quickly as it came.

""Don't. I- I'm fine, ok? Don't worry about me.""

He knew Kate was lying. She knew that he knew. But she pressed on regardless.

""...What hurt the most was that no one stood up for me. The cousins were silent whenever my father raised his voice. When I looked to mom, she... she just turned her head. Couldn't meet my gaze. They just let him do it. Let me be his chew toy, his verbal punching bag, because they didn't want to risk gaining his ire as I had.

It came to a head on day 7, when I was going over our inventory of supplies for the 5th time in an hour. It was the only thing I could do to entertain myself besides counting the ceiling tiles. It was silent in the bunker save for my rearranging the cans and bottles in the storage closet, just barely audible clinks and scrapes, the sound of glass rattling against glass and metal sliding against wood.

I heard a roar from behind me.

""SHUT UP!""

I jumped and started to turn, but then his hands gripped my throat.

""SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUTUPSHUTUPSHUTUP!""

He was choking me from behind. My- m-my own father, trying to kill me, over a few tiny sounds.

For a few, agonizingly long seconds I was too shocked to do anything but clutch at the hands on my throat, wheezing for air, but then survival instincts took hold. I lurched forward, managing to slip out of his grip, took a desperate lungful and grabbed a glass bottle we had emptied a few days back before turning and smashing it against his face, breaking it into pieces.

He cried out in pain and clutched his face, but as I swung again he grabbed my arm with both hands and wrenched. I heard more than felt the horrific crack my bone made as it twisted into an unnatural angle, before he grabbed the bottle from me and gouged it into my now-crooked limb.

I still had some adrenaline left flowing through me, dulling the pain, and knew I had to get out of there before it faded and the pain crippled me. With my good arm I punched him in the face as hard as I could and ran past him as he clutched at the broken cartilage that was once his nose.

As I ran past my cousins, my mom, it felt like time slowed. I looked at them, and their expressions... not one had so much as stood up to help me, to investigate what the noise and fuss was about, to even look at me. They just... j-just didn't care, as long as it wasn't *them* in his crosshairs.""

Kate wiped away the tears from her face once more, before glancing out the viewport at the burning planet below.

""I escaped the bunker, heedless of radiation or other possible dangers- they certainly couldn't be worse than the hell I just escaped- and ran as far as I could before the pain overwhelmed me. I just sat in a ditch about 5 miles down the road from the farm, brain fogged- partly by the pain, but mostly by the grief. The grief of a daughter who lost her father. The man I once knew, I once loved, that took me to ballgames for my birthdays, who watched my god-awful poetry recitals in high school, who hugged me as I got my bachelor's diploma...""

The tears stopped, and her expression was one of dull, exhausted sorrow.

""...That man is dead. He was dead the minute he set foot in that precious fucking bunker of his.""

She set down her (now mangled from clenching so hard) spoon and stared into the distance for a while before continuing.

""I passed out at some point. Then I woke up in a dark room with an alien standing over me, and... well. You know the rest.""

Y'ggdrasog leaned back against the wall for support, his legs feeling like jelly. This was... so much worse than anything he had imagined. And his heart broke at what he had to say next.

""I... ...I hate myself for this, but- look. Standard protocol for injured civilians in a first contact scenario is to patch them up, then leave them with a relative, if possible-""

She stared at him for a moment with the eyes of one who has known far too much suffering for her youth, and responded in the hollow, dead voice of one who cared not what happened to her anymore.

""If that's true, you may as well have let the infection kill me.""

A flurry of colors glowed across his face, as he started and faltered sentence after sentence.

""I... I can't- Look, it- I mean... I- I have no choice but to- I'd be risking-""

Suddenly, his eyes went wide and he glowed a pure white.

""Wait... That just might- WAIT! Hold on, I need to check- just give me a second-""

Kate flinched from the sudden movement as he dived for a holo-tablet sitting nearby.

""What are you doing?!""

Y'ggdrasog ignored her, concentrating on scrolling through what looked to be some sort of massive form, chock full of bulleted lists and footnotes.

""...I swear to god, if you're- I dunno, doing your **taxes** or something right now while I'm about to get sent back down to what will almost certainly be my *death*, I WILL-""

""YES!"" Y'ggdrasog said, shoving the tablet into her good hand. ""LOOK HERE!""

She frowned at the unfamiliar symbols. ""I... I can't read this, it's just a bunch of squiggles and weird shapes.""

""What? ...Oh spirits above, I'm sorry, I forgot, you're not- no implant for-""

Kate pinched the bridge of her nose, tossing the tablet back to him as he continued to stammer.

""You'd better start explaining **real** fast or I'll- I'll... ...When I think of something sufficiently bad, I'll DO IT!"" she finished lamely.

He was silent for a moment, glowing bright blue with his head cocked to the side before composing himself.

""Uh- right. Um... Section 15a, subsection 45 of the 5th article-""

""Skip the legalese and get to the point.""

""...When participating in an uplifting, a member of the uplifting team in question is allowed to choose between a credit-bonus or a choice piece of paraphernalia from the race in question, up to and including pets.""

"".....I'm not following.""

""It doesn't have a hard definition for what constitutes a pet! It just says ""a living being of your choice that you have formed an emotional attachment to, and that you are equipped to handle, house, and provide care to.""

"".......If you're suggesting what I think you're suggesting-""

Y'ggdrasog's mandibles clacked together decisively.

""You won't have to go back.""

She stared at him for a moment, face blank, as he continued to babble about how no, he didn't see her as his lesser, this was just to keep her safe, she'd be free to leave at any time and would have equal rights to any other individual in the collective and so on, his voice fading into the background as the most important part repeated over and over in her head.

*You won't have to go back.*

Her eyes filled with tears and she interrupted his rambling by flinging her good arm around him to pull him into a tight hug, starting to sob again. Muffled by his carapace-covered chest came two words that held the weight of the world in them.

^(“…Thank you..."")

As the shock of the moment wore off, he smiled, closing his eyes and gently returning the hug, glowing a dull pink as he did so.

""...My pleasure.""",159,True
ipiqmz3,WritingPrompts,"PART 2

Believe it or not, there are actually VERY extensive protocols in place when making first contact with a new sapient race. …Granted, the various races that make up the Ul’dril Galactic Collective only had to pull that set of protocols out and dust it off once every couple millennia or so, but they’re there. And in the case of the discovery of Earth and the humans upon it, they followed them to the letter.

To summarize said protocols completely would take several hours, but the most important directives were as follows:

1: Discreetly monitor the species for a while so as to A: determine their general behavioral patterns and physiology, and B: let the auto-translator AI algorithms pull as much language data as possible to generate an accurate language package (no one wanted to say “where’s the restroom” when meaning to say “we come in peace” like what infamously happened when the Jazuli joined the collective due to the scout ships rushing things).

Only upon completion of a comprehensive language platform for all native languages of the population would contact be established, broadcasting a global message of peace and a desire for peaceful contact in as many languages as is feasible.

2: During initial, first-five-year interactions, under NO circumstances resort to any violence whatsoever save for disabling enemy weapons if under attack in a manner that does not harm those wielding them. Anyone found guilty of deliberately harming a member of a first contact species in a manner that isn’t self-defense within the first 50 years will be summarily executed, and the remains of the guilty presented to the species in question to show that the violent individual was an outlier, nothing more. …That last bit is rather draconian, yes, but “first impressions” and all that.

3: If the species agrees to join the Collective, uplift the species to the current levels of technology that the rest of the galactic collective uses as soon as is reasonable, so as to provide a post-scarcity way of life for all sapient species. This serves to reduce the probability of conflict over such petty things as physical resources or advanced blueprints/technology.

When the first contact of humanity finally commenced and the broadcast went out to Earth, all individuals of the Collective involved on the project waited with excitement and baited breath.

…That excitement slowly turned to horror as the helpless onlookers saw the world below them almost immediately fall into complete chaos.

**---------**

Despite what had transpired regarding fixing her up, it still took several hours of rest, double that for time to process her situation, and quite a bit of gentle prodding and coaxing before Kate was convinced she was safe enough to follow Y'ggrasog to eat at a proper dining table instead of in her impromptu hidey-hole. She sat across from him, slowly eating some fabricated oatmeal, as he simply watched and waited, before finally feeling comfortable enough to break the silence.

""Do you want to talk about it now? I mean, regarding what you said about your family?""

He saw her grip on the newly-fabricated spoon tighten until her knuckles turned bone-white. There was an awkward silence for a few moments.

""...I understand if it's an uncomfortable subject, I was just-""

""No, it's- it's fine. I'm just still reeling at- well. All of this. Aliens. Spaceships. ...The world going mad.""

""What was your experience like on the ground? I'm afraid the view from a spacecraft is rather broad, but shallow. And I'm curious; I've seen several, almost blinding-white flashes dotting the atmosphere, but whenever I inquire about it to my superiors they just give me an odd look and ignore the question. ...What happened?""

She sighed. ""A bunch of sick old men afraid of change, desperately clinging to what little power they have, and simultaneously deciding it was high time that the world committed suicide, that's what that was. Israel, Pakistan, the USA, Russia, China- countless others, I'm sure, but those are the ones that launched the most ICBM's at each other. All these old, pointless grudges flaring up at once during the panic, over events that took place generations ago.""

""Icy... beans? That didn't translate well-""

""Nuclear warheads. Thousands of them.""

Y'ggrasog's mandibles dropped open, his bioluminescence going  through the entire rainbow within seconds before settling on a dull beige.

""I- ................oh.""

""...Yeah...""

""I... I am so, so very sorry. I- we had no idea this would lead to-""

""Don't apologize for humans fucking themselves over. It's in our nature. ...But I'm getting off topic. You wanted to know about this...""

Kate motioned down to her broken arm. There were a few moments of silence, then Kate gave a wry smile.

""Ironically, when the panic started, my father's only reaction was feeling very, very validated. He was a ""prepper."" Built a lead-lined bunker on our farm in rural Montana, constantly kept it stocked with enough rations and water to last us multiple years. Constantly mocked about it by what few neighbors we had in the area and me most of all- I thought it was an enormous waste of time and money that we could put into the rest of the farm instead. ...But I suppose it paid off in the end. He rushed us all down there as soon as the news reports came in.

We had only been down there a few hours when the radio updates stopped. All the EMPs from the nukes fried the radio stations' ability to send out information. Until they could be repaired, all we had was silence, and there certainly weren't any electronic shops still open to fix the issue. We were just... alone. My father, mother, a couple older cousins that were visiting at the time, and me. All with nothing but our own company to entertain ourselves with.

...All the research he'd done, all the food and water and air filters he'd stocked, but he failed to account for one thing; morale. He didn't pack so much as a card game down there, and the boredom kicked in sooner rather than later. We were all bored, of course, but- I dunno, it just... affected my father differently than the rest.

Boredom turned to spite, then anger... and then hate, on the 5th day. He just kept verbally *unloading* on me at random, about how he was right all this time, about how I was wrong to doubt him for building that bunker, that I was an ungrateful little bitch, and- a-and that-""

A tear dripped from the tip of her nose, fizzling against the nanobots as it landed on her arm.

""...And that I didn't deserve to be in there with the rest of them.""

iphehjh,WritingPrompts,"Y’ggrasog’s friends often joked that he was damn near emotionless. He had seen a lot in his life as a spacer. Many such things were wondrous. He had seen stars go supernova, space dust form beautiful clouds thousands of miles wide, and caught the frosted trails of comets slinging close enough to a star to off-gas their icy payloads.

…But many, many more such things were horrible, tragic, and stark reminders of the fragility of life. He had seen crewmates suffer catastrophic decompression due to shoddy suits, and others die of radiation poisoning after the idiot navigator had added a couple more zeroes than necessary when calculating how close to a star they could safely travel. 

Throughout all of this, he took it upon himself to remain stoic, to keep going, no matter how much he wanted to give up. It took a *lot* to so much as phase him.

…And as he watched the pitiful creature before him, he was struggling to maintain the titanic willpower required to not start ugly-crying on the spot.

The human (female, in her mid-20s by the looks of it based off his limited knowledge of their biology) had long since gotten over the initial surprise upon realizing she had been abducted from her homeworld, but was now curled into a ball in the corner of the room where she had constructed a farcical barricade out of whatever was nearby. Cushions, pillows, a shelving unit, a few thermal blankets here and there. He could see through the shadows she clung to that her arm was bleeding, her unfocused, bloodshot eyes and rose-colored cheeks were wet, her chest heaving as she went from panicked hyperventilating to quiet sobs to desperate pleading to no one in particular in a voice rendered hoarse from the initial screaming which had (thankfully) stopped a few minutes hence.

“Please oh please d-don’t let me die here I don’t want to die I don’t want to die I’m n-not ready to die oh god please someone help me I don’t want to-“

He cleared his throat, the sudden noise causing her to flinch and clutch her injured arm tighter than before.

“…Miss, please, I have no intention of-“

“OHGODPLEASEDON’TKILLME!”

“I- I have no intention whatsoever of causing you to come to any harm. Just…”

She stared at him for a few seconds, gaze full of sheer terror, before she screwed her eyes shut, blocking the world out.

“Please wake up please wake up this is a nightmare this has to be a fucking nightmare oh god please wake up-“

“No, miss, this… I’m afraid this is very much real.”

Her eyes flew open, staring at him, tears welling in her eyes from the recognition that he spoke truly, before burying her face in the crook of her non-injured arm and continuing to weep.

He struggled to remember the portions of intel surrounding the physiology and psychology this species possessed.

“Just… uh- take a few deep breaths. In and out, slow. Can you do that for me? Please?”

He watched as she raised her head slightly and gazed at him, her eyes wide and fearful, but as he continued to stand there, not daring to make any sudden movements, he noticed her breathing starting to slow, her shoulders relaxing a bit.

“That’s a bit better. Can… can you please tell me your name?”

She was silent for several seconds before letting out a whimpered answer so quiet his auto-translator barely picked it up.

^”K-Kate…”

“Kate. Alright. …Kate, I know you’re scared, but I only want to help you.”

A few moments of silence passed, broken only by the quiet sound of Kate’s slow, ragged breaths.

“Listen to me. The only reason I brought you here is due to your current condition and the vast distance between your position at the time my sensors detected you and the closest human population center. Your appendage is bleeding and a bone is fractured quite badly. While the blood loss is not enough to kill you, the ship’s auto-doc system detected an infection growing within the wound that it calculated would kill you before you could reach aid from your own kind. I merely wish to help you before it gets any worse.”

Another minute of silence passed before she finally spoke.

^“…..Ok…”

“Good. This will only take a few moments…”

Trying to move as slowly as possible, he reached up to a nearby panel on the wall and typed in a code. A small drone, about the size of a baseball, appeared from a nearby hole in the wall. He clutched it in his hand and extended it out to her, causing her to shrink back away from him.

“This is a medical droid. I’ve programmed it with all knowledge of human anatomy we’ve been able to decipher. It’s just going to administer a solution to flush the wound of contaminants and sterilize it, apply a medical gel that will bind to any damaged tissues to stop the bleeding, then install a- …hm. I suppose your race doesn’t have this tech yet… uh- just think of it as something like an advanced hybrid between a cast and prosthetic that will prevent you from accidentally injuring yourself further. All I need you to do is just uncover your arm and remain as still as possible for a bit. Ok?”

She remained motionless for a few seconds before slowly, gingerly removing the hand she had been clutching to the wound, wincing as she shifted slightly to face the droid.

It went to work, and the process was over within seconds. She gingerly poked at the metallic substance covering her arm, the fear on her face slowly being replaced by bemusement, before finally speaking.

“What… what is this stuff?”

“It’s a collection of self-sterilizing nanobots programmed to your physiology. They will adapt to any movements you make in an attempt to keep your arm as still as possible as it recovers. If you were a member of my own species the bone and tissues would already be repaired at this point, but… well, we still don’t know enough about your kind for that sort of thing to be possible yet, so we’ll just have to let the bone and tissue heal by itself.”

“…What’s your name?”

“Y’grassog.”

She sniffled before replying in almost a whisper.

^“…Thank ^you...”

His mandibles broke into his species’ equivalent of a grin, and his bioluminescence shifted hues to show the change.

“My pleasure.”

They sat in silence for a few moments before he broke it.

“I’m going to check back in on you shortly, and in the meantime I’ll calibrate the fabricator to produce some food and drink your species can safely metabolize so we can get you fed and watered. Then we can get you back to your people-“

“NO!”

ipbkrnf,WritingPrompts,"You want to know the secret of how to take over the world? The inexperienced would-be despots of the world would say something along the lines of “power,” or “fear.” …But they’re idiots, and the most they can expect is a few years at best “ruling” as a crackpot warlord over a petty stretch of land in some underdeveloped country before they’re gunned down, poisoned, stabbed, or some other method of assassination so the next idiot in a long, long queue of the fuckers can take their place. No. It’s not “power,” which is a vague and useless enough concept that I’m loathe to even put it to ink. Nor is it fear.

It’s PR.

…Well, not *just* PR, of course. One also needs organizational skills, wealth, the ability to manage said wealth efficiently and profitably, and enough people skills to actually manage to make those around you and those below you *love you.* Or, failing that, at least tolerate you enough to not wish to see your downfall.

But at the end of the day, one’s public image is among the absolute most important things to cultivate, if you truly wish to change the world to suit your liking. For you see, the people of this little blue planet we live on are fickle, selfish, and bothersome little things. I would know, I’m one of them. And to change the world, one must first mold the perceptions of the populace towards you to make them want- no, to *embrace* the little puppet strings you wrap around them, and wish to see *your* desires come to pass.

It will be difficult. It will be stressful, especially at first. But when you accrue a positive image, accrue enough wealth without indulging every base desire that suits your fancy- ugh, so much potential every white-collar criminal squanders away with their 5th mega yacht or their 20th beachfront condo with 3 herbal jacuzzis…

Ah, I’m getting off track. The point is, once you have that positive image, wealth, and, heh, “power,” you must *become* the mask you wear. Never take it off. Never reveal what lies underneath. For to do so will tip the dominoes in place to one’s downfall.

Provide free, well-kept housing for the poor, the sick, the disabled. To go the extra mile, participate in building it with your own hands, it’ll make for good pictures. Feed and water the disenfranchised. Help those in need. And above all else, ignore your ego. Become the mask. Become the savior of the meek and the downtrodden. For it is *they* that hold the true “power” in this world. At the end of the day, you are but an individual. A single person among billions. And when it comes down to it, no matter what stratagems you may have in play, no matter how hard of a grip you may think you have on your precious “power,” you are hopelessly outnumbered.

“Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer.” And the most terrifying enemy of all is the populace, as *my* enemies found out. The freaks of the world given special abilities through lab accidents, discovering “magical” artifacts and so on. Threats that I myself couldn’t initially deal with… but the populace could.

After all, who *wouldn’t* wish to protect the savior of the masses from some “Captain Underpants”-looking idiot in spandex? Especially when certain articles began to circulate about, oh, I dunno… all the civilians they had killed by tossing some other superpowered freak through a skyscraper? The property damage they caused with every petty grudge match?

All it took was the development of an alternative to these innumerable flawed, sapient lab accidents. An anonymous team of scientists and engineers measuring in the thousands, all under my employ, and all developing tech that the average citizen could rely on to protect them. Who needs some garishly-caped psycho causing mayhem and collateral damage when fighting back against the threat of the week when, say, a swarm of self-repairing nano bots could be directed to immobilize the threat, fly it to a depopulated area, and vaporize them without so much as a scraped knee to the average citizen? …Or how about one of my worldwide HELIOS array’s lasers to disintegrate that asteroid hurtling towards the planet instead of the Superman-wannabe punching it into pieces only for it to rain down as deadly shrapnel on the helpless populace below?

It didn’t take long for these inventions to sway public opinion against these upstarts in tights. My machines worked for the greater good. These idiots worked to stoke their own egos, causing havoc while playing God in tacky body-hugging neon.

Internally, I may as well have been jumping for joy when one of these “superheroes” grew irritated enough to disintegrate one of the peaceful protesters rallying against them… before summarily being beaten to death within minutes by their fellows without me having to so much as lift a finger. I, of course, maintained the mask, and called for the regulation of these freaks of nature. That’s all I wanted initially; annihilation could wait for a time. …But the massacres continued. So petty. Pathetic, really. Having tasted it, they didn’t want to give up their “power.” And so, as the populace begged me to do… they found my nano bots ready and waiting.

It was over within hours. Some fought, some tried to hide, it made no difference. …And to tell you the truth, the nano bots only accounted for a little over 75% of the vigilante fatalities that day. 

And not a soul mourned them.

God, I can only imagine how ridiculous I must have looked. 

I kept looking around for the source of the noise, thinking- no, praying, that this had to be some weird joke by a few bored teenagers or something, because the alternative was that I was going crazy or that there was someone in my apartment.

*Well, you certainly* look *insane, but I’ll reserve my judgement.*

I whipped around, but the only other living thing I could see was the spider, and it sure as hell wasn’t it speaking-

*Don’t be so sure. And you know, “it” is a rather rude thing to call someone.*

I did a double take as I saw the spider raise a leg and wave at me. Ok, no doubt about it, I was crazy.

*No, you’re just confused. Just calm down, and we can resolve this.*

I shakily walked over to the terrarium.

“Are… are you speaking?” I felt stupid the moment I said it out loud. Of course the spider wasn’t talking...

*Well, you’re half-right. My kind don’t exactly “speak,” as your kind does.*

I glanced down at the spider again as it slowly dawned on me. “You- …you’re in my head?”

*Yes. I have been listening to your thoughts for some time, but I hadn’t felt comfortable communicating with you up until now.*

“Ok. I… I have a telepathic spider in my apartment. …That’s not a sentence I was ever expecting to say.”

I heard what can only be described as a giggle from them.

*That is remarkably similar to what I told myself before I called you “love” earlier, as well. I never thought I’d fall in love with one of your kind, that’s for certain.*

I’ll admit, I didn’t know how to take this. On one hand, “one of your kind” was a tad rude, and on the other, a telepathic spider had just confessed its- their, love to me. Not something that happens every day.

“You… love me?”

*A charming rescuer swoops me away from my imminent death, tends to my wounds, lets me stay in their home as I recover, nurses me back to health, and then proposes to me. …It’s all very romantic, wouldn’t you say?*

“Well, I suppose, I mean, I hadn’t really- wait, *”proposes to you?”* What are you talking about?!""

*You… you proposed to me. You gifted me with sustenance that you could have used instead. …Is that not how your kind proposes a life shared together?*

""Wait… are you saying that my microwaving some frozen mice for you counts as a proposal for marriage in your eyes?”

*…I don’t know what “marriage” is, but among my people, presenting a kill to another is not done lightly. It is symbolic of presenting one’s own life to another. The carcass, carrying precious nutrients but offered freely to another, represents that the one presenting it to the other would rather the other live than them, and the life taken from the prey represents the desire to spend one’s lives together as mates.*

*And as I’ve been here these past few days, I understood you for what you were: Very, very kind. You are someone who sees beauty in my people- no, in all life. Worrying over my condition every day when most of your kind would kill me without a second thought. It is why we must cling to the shadows, underground, or in other such remote areas of the world for our own safety. You are not like any human I’ve ever met. And so I decided to accept your invitation.*

…I was flattered, but also incredibly taken aback by just how different our cultures were.

“Oh. I… I didn’t know, I was… I was just trying to keep you alive. Humans don’t view presenting food  to others quite so… intensely, as you do, so I… I didn’t view it like that.”

*………..Ah. I… I see.* They seemed to droop a bit in the terrarium.

There was a very awkward silence for a few seconds. And then, I surprised myself with what I said next:

“That… that doesn’t mean “no,” though.”

They perked up a bit.

“Listen, I- this is very sudden, and I haven’t even spoken with you up until now. I’ve never even met one of your people before, and… I dunno. I’m just really overwhelmed and confused right now about how to react to all of this.”

*…I understand. And- well, I suppose it was incredibly presumptuous of me to assume there would be no cultural differences between your people and mine, when even our methods of communication are incredibly different. I apologize.*

“That’s alright, um… oh jeez, I don’t even know your name, and I haven’t even introduced myself yet. I’m Alex. What’s your name?”

*I am Telamohria, 3rd of clan Kinethryrste.*

“Well, it’s very nice to meet you, Telamohria. …Er- what’s the second bit mean, the clan part?”

*It’s a designation of who our progenitors are. I am the third child of my brood mother, who is the leader of the congregation of my people that dwell within this city- or rather, underneath it.*

“…Wait, does that mean you’re like… some kind of royalty?”

*…Is that a problem?*

My mind went blank for a few seconds. “No, I just… wasn’t expecting some… spider monarch to fall in love with me, is all.”

They giggled again. *I suppose today is just full of surprises for you, isn’t it.*

“Listen… I’m going to go back to sleep now. I still need to process all of this, but I’m still open to… seeing where this goes, I suppose. Is that alright?”

*If it should please you, yes. Rest well, Alex.*

Otherwise, I would have missed out on getting to know the person who I would later have known to be the love of my life.

Oh, hush.",279,True
io4p6fw,WritingPrompts,"I’ve always had a soft spot for spiders. Most people despise them, of course. That’s just human nature. People fear what they don’t understand. Mix in millennia of survival instincts driving people to react to sudden motion out of the corner of one’s eye and of course people will fear them.

But not me. I’ve always adored them. So long as they’re not a major threat to one’s health (such as black widow spiders) they’re harmless, eat household pests and keep to themselves. I guarantee that whenever you see one, they will definitely be way more frightened of you than the other way around. I know I’d certainly be scared shitless if I saw something 1000 times my size walking in my general direction.

As a result, you’ll find plenty of cobwebs and the like lining the ceiling corners in my house, and I’ve kept tarantulas as pets since I was a kid. God, you should have seen the look on my mother’s face when my father surprised me with one on my 10th birthday, absolutely priceless… but I’m getting off track.

I was 24 at the time, walking home from work one day when I spotted some kids poking at something with a stick. It was only when I got closer that I realized it was a tarantula bigger than any I’d seen before. Several of the kids were keeping their distance out of fear, but a couple of them were making a game of tormenting the poor thing. They kept poking at it, jabbing it in the legs, the abdomen. I know people usually think kids are innocent, but that certainly wasn’t the case for these little shitheads. Tormenting any innocent creature for the sake of it… despicable.

I stepped in, shoved them aside- rude, and with potentially litigious consequences if their parents heard about it, I know, but I wasn’t interested in being polite; I was focused on saving the poor thing’s life before they poked its eyes out or something. Before the other little snot-nosed brats could react I had taken my jacket off, gently picked the poor thing up with it, and started running. I had expected the spider to struggle, try and escape, and I wouldn’t have blamed them, but it was almost motionless, which worried me.

I took it home as fast as I could and placed it in a spare terrarium I had laying around that used to be the home of Daisy, a tarantula I had for years, but had unfortunately passed a couple months prior. God I miss that little troublemaker... 

…Anyway, it wasn’t looking good. One of the shitheads cruelly poking away had punctured its abdomen- not a deep wound, but spiders don’t have a lot of blood to spare, so even a minor scrape can mean big trouble for these creatures. I cleaned the wound as best I could using a sterilized q-tip before sealing the wound with some superglue- hey, don’t look at me like that. I didn’t exactly have access to a spider hospital, and it’s not stupid if it works. 

Again, I was worried that the spider was so docile during this process. Any creature that goes through such stress will often be too scared to even think about sitting still, even if wounded, especially if something the size of a spider skyscraper is poking away at said wound. But the following day, it was still alive and well.

A few days later and the tarantula was looking much better. I was actually surprised by how quick it had recovered, not to mention the appetite. 4 mice within 3 days is no small feat, even with how large the spider was. I noticed a change in behavior after the first meal, more energetic, less prone to resting. It almost seemed as though the spider was watching me at all times. I put it down to the food helping to perk them up a bit.

Two weeks had gone by before I first heard the voice, as I was trying to sleep one night.

*Thank you.*

I sat up and looked around, rubbing the sleep from my eyes. There was no one else in the room with me. I scratched my head, confused. Maybe I had drifted off and dreamt it? I laid back down and closed my eyes.

*It wasn’t a dream, love.*

My eyes shot back open and I bolted out of bed, grabbing the baseball bat I kept by the side of it at all times (hey, you never know). Looking warily around, I again didn’t see anyone. I sat back down on the bed, not knowing what to think. What was going on?

*There’s no need to be scared.*

“Ok, what the hell is going on here‽ Is this some weird joke? Come out, whoever you are!”

*Calm down, I just want to talk.*

It was as though the voice was coming from everywhere at once, but also inside my head. Hard to describe without having experienced it, but that voice has been my constant companion for years now. …But I’m getting ahead of myself.

A multimillionaire French dentist was jailed on Thursday for “wiping the smiles off the faces” of hundreds of patients by maiming them withexpensive, unnecessary and harmful treatments to boost his earnings.

Lionel Guedj, 42, had promised patients ""celebrity smiles"".

Instead, he killed the nerve of 3,900 healthy teeth in pointless root canal treatment between 2006 to 2012, causing many of his patients to develop serious dental problems after rushed and botched work by Guedj, who saw up to 70 people a day.

“I went in for two fillings and came out with half my teeth devitalised,” said one plaintiff.

""I had lost half my teeth by the time I was 45, and at 55 I no longer had any, only implants,"" said Ouassila, who declined to give her full name, ahead of the ruling.

Some said the trauma from teeth and bridges that fell out and chronic pain and infections led to social problems and even divorce.

Meanwhile, Guedj drove a Ferrari and owned a €700,000 yacht, paintings by Andy Warhol, three flats in Paris, two in the Alps and a block of flats in Perpignan in southern France.

At one point, he was the “wealthiest dentist in France”, raking in €2.9 million in 2010 alone.



On Thursday, the criminal court in Marseille, southern France, handed Guedj an eight-year prison term. His father and accomplice, Carnot, 71, also a dentist, received a five-year prison term.

Most of his patients were from impoverished council estates in north Marseille and were on low incomes, so were able to claim the cost of the dental care back from the social security system, the court was told.

“Money was what fuelled Lionel Guedj and Jean-Claude (the first name the father used) sought only the success of his son whatever the cost,” said prosecutor Marion Chabot during the trial.

The pair were found guilty of inflicting “voluntary violence leading to mutilation or a permanent disability” on 327 patients. They have been struck off the dental register.

Presiding judge Céline Ballerini said that the two men were guilty of industrial-grade abuse with invasive and unnecessary dental operations that “wiped the smile” off patients’ faces, “destroyed” lives, and left many in “unbearable pain”.

They deserved tough sentences, she said, due to the “number of victims”, the number of years over which they committed the crimes (six), and the “very serious” amount of money they had creamed off the national health system, compounded by the amount it cost to repair the damage.

Furthermore, they had exploited and sullied “the dignified status of surgeon-dentist”, she said.

Arms crossed behind surgical masks, the pair remained impassive when the sentence was read out. In contrast, hundreds of victims burst into applause, prompting a reprimand from the judge who remarked that one “should never rejoice at a prison term”.

They had denied the charges but their lawyers said they would plead guilty to the lesser offence of involuntary wounding, which carries a maximum sentence of three years in prison.

“Never, oh never, did I intend to wound, to harm,” Lionel Guedj had told the court.

In a group letter to the court on the last day of the proceedings, the victims expressed their relief at being able to express themselves during the trial. “If only you knew how many tears have flowed, how many lives have been destroyed, how many families have suffered.

But throughout this month, we have been heard and are relieved to have been taken into consideration as plaintiffs after years of silence,” they said.",38,False

As for talismans, Radagon’s Soreseal is useful if you’re below around level 100ish. Past that and the damage increase you take while wearing it just isn’t worth it. The canvas talisman + flock’s canvas talisman are good options if you’re using offensive incantations, though the latter requires completing a very lengthy questline. The fire scorpion charm can increase your fire damage significantly if you’re a fan of using Blackflame/fire monk incantations, but it is another one that increases the damage you take, so I definitely wouldn’t use it alongside Radagon’s Soreseal. And you can’t go wrong with swapping in defensive talismans like the various drake shield talismans or the turtle talisman for some stamina regen.

This (or some later event) could have been said schism.

imo the latter option, that a schism formed, is more likely, for two reasons.

#FAQ

#What does this mean?

The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.

#Why did you do this?

There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:

•	⁠Rudeness towards other Redditors,
•	⁠Spreading incorrect information,
•	⁠Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s.

#Am I banned from the Reddit?

No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.

#I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?

Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.

#How can I prevent this from happening in the future?

Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.

This game (and all FROM titles) are infamous for being extremely challenging for a very good reason. It is completely normal to die a bunch. You are not a failure or “bad” for doing so, especially if this is your first FROM game.

2: progression is a tad different in this one.

Past FROM entries have been more linear in which areas the designers expect you to go through in what order. In this one, the devs use the first few bosses in the game as tools to teach the player that is 100% alright to run away and level up somewhere less challenging if you come to a roadblock. If you can’t beat Margit now, explore a bit. Explore some caves/tombs. Head south to the Weeping Peninsula to explore there as well. Only come back once you’ve leveled up a few times and feel ready.
